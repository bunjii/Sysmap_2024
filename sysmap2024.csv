An existing classroom located in Marrakech city was considered a case study building. The building model was analyzed under six Moroccan climate zones. The SA was applied on 16 design variables and performed using the Morris method implemented in the tool Simlab to rank each design variable based on its influence on the objective function (overall energy demand). The SA results showed that the solar absorptance of the internal roof, wall, and ground floor and the ground hollow core slab thickness impacted less the overall energy demand. Therefore, the only remaining variables showing the most relevant effect will be optimized afterward. The optimization phase was conducted by coupling the generic optimization tool GenOpt with TRNSYS. The optimum solution was selected based on the Pareto front approach. The obtained results assessed the effectiveness of the adopted methodological approach in significant minimization of the required thermal loads. Furthermore, the values of each optimum design variables set differ from one climate zone to another; leading to energy demand reduction varying from 30 to 42%, in comparison with the original design building. © The Author(s) 2023.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:36:03","","309-332","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01436244231161944","Architectural design; Floors; Structural design; Energy management; Multi-objective optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Multiobjective optimization; Design variables; Energy conservation; Solar buildings; Building envelopes; Multi-objectives optimization; Climate models; sensitivity analysis; Energy demands; Thermal load; Energy savings potential; Thermal behaviours; classroom building envelope; Classroom building envelope; Energy  savings; energy saving; Energy-savings; Moroccan climate zone; moroccan climate zones; thermal loads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the energy efficiency of HVAC systems is of paramount importance. They provide energy for both residential and commercial sectors. As a result, assessing building energy usage is a critical step in optimizing building energy consumption. The impact of eight input factors on the two output variables, heating and cooling loads, for residential structures was explored in this study. For this purpose, the SVR-supervised machine learning algorithm was used. Despite its advantages, such as predictive accuracy and robustness, this method suffers from the fact that there is no specific rule for fitting its parameters. Therefore, six meta-heuristic optimization algorithms were investigated, and the strongest algorithm for optimal parameter fitting for the SVR model was presented. The correlation and error parameters analysis showed that the hybrid model SVR-AEO has the best performance in simulating residential buildings' heating and cooling loads.

The heat requirement of a building, and thus its carbon emission, can be lowered by optimizing the supply and return temperature of the heating system. A lower supply temperature enables a wider variety of transition pathways towards sustainable heating with reduced carbon emissions. However, the minimum supply temperature that guarantees acceptable indoor temperatures in existing dwellings during design weather conditions is still unknown. In this study, we determine the minimum supply temperature by fitting a 2 R–2C model to hourly measurement data. The measurement data is obtained from a representative set of 220 existing gas-fired dwellings in the Netherlands. The heating system of each dwelling was equipped with a pulse flowmeter and temperature sensors on both the supply and return side. Additionally, data was collected from the thermostat in the main living room and the gas boiler. The data was supplemented with weather data from a nearby weather station. The data-driven model shows that the minimum supply temperature can be lower than 55 °C for 60% of the dwellings during design weather conditions (i.e., −10 °C in the Netherlands). Moreover, the minimum supply temperature is poorly correlated with general building properties, such as the building typology, construction period or specific annual space heating demand (kWh/(m2yr)). On the contrary, the ratio between the required and installed heat output of the radiators in the heating system is a promising parameter to predict the minimum design supply temperature of an individual dwelling that guarantees an acceptable indoor temperature during design weather conditions. © 2023 The Authors","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:34:28","","","","","284","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2023.129183","Architectural design; Carbon; design method; Structural design; building; carbon emission; Residential building; heating; Housing; Meteorology; Europe; Space heating; Indoor temperature; temperature profile; Heating system; Carbon emissions; Data-driven methods; demand-side management; Design condition; Design weather conditions; Measurement data; Measurements; Netherlands; Radiator; Radiators; Supply temperature; Supply temperatures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calibrated simulation model based on indoor and outdoor measured temperature for a school of interest is used to evaluate the optimization strategies. This paper aims to search for the optimum school building design under three simultaneous conflicting objective functions: (1) the minimization of overheating hours to less than 40 h as required by Building Bulletin BB101 building code by using passive mitigation measures, (2) the minimization of heating energy use to less than 15 kW/m2 according to passive house requirements and thus the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and (3) the minimization of artificial lighting energy use to less than the current lighting energy use by maximization of daylighting usage without exceeding acceptable glare index in classrooms. Ten building design variables are selected, which could generate approximately 300,000 solutions. The developed methodology reduced the numbers to 14,400 solutions and found seven Pareto solutions that comply with the three objectives and their constraints. High energy-efficient building envelope, appropriate window-wall ratio and window type, natural ventilation during the day, and night cooling can play a key role in achieving the objectives under current weather conditions.

How to deal with the constraints in the optimization model is critical to optimal solution quality and efficiency, while is usually ignored when selecting optimization approaches. This study introduces three typical categories of constrained optimization approaches that integrate common and advanced constraint handling techniques (CHTs), including optimization with penalty function (SPF and DPF), biased bi-objective optimization (BBO) and reinforcement learning guided optimization (RL-SPF). To better match the high-efficiency requirement of practical problems, some improvements are made to the latter two approaches. An energy-efficient building form optimization problem is described and combined with different spatial and environmental constraints to construct five groups of experiments. The results illustrate that BBO achieves the best performance on average, particularly outstanding in convergence speed. The superiority of RL-SPF is obviously affected by the constraint handling capacity of RL model, and both penalty functions are not robust and efficient enough in solving practical BPO solutions. Additionally, further investigation on different CHTs reveals that preserving good infeasible solutions are more effective than simply improving the proportion of feasible solutions, which provides a promising direction for future work on developing new constraint optimization approaches. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:27:50","","","","","277","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2023.127540","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Constrained optimization; Building performance; Building design; Building performance optimization; Reinforcement learning; Performance optimizations; Energy efficient building; energy efficiency; Bi-objective optimization; adoption constraint; Biased bi-objective optimization; Biased Bi-Objective optimization; Constraint handling; Constraint handling techniques; Constraint-handling techniques; convergence; Energy-efficient building design; learning; Penalty function; reinforcement; Reinforcement learnings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the performance of passive PCMs in buildings is highly dependent on the melting temperatures employed, as well as the climate where the building is located. Therefore, the present contribution describes an optimization-based method to design passive latent energy storage in buildings by using PCMs with different melting temperatures. To achieve this goal, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is coupled with the building energy models developed in EnergyPlus to find the best trade-off between annual heating and cooling loads. A small office is chosen as a case study to evaluate the energy performance of the buildings incorporating the proposed PCM approach. Three different PCM layers are added to the ceilings and the external and internal walls of the building, and their parametric models are developed in EnergyPlus to optimize the melting temperature and thickness of each PCM layer simultaneously. Moreover, a method to select climate-representative locations according to the ASHRAE 169-2020 climate classification and within the WMO Region VI (Europe) is proposed and applied, resulting in eight well-representative locations. An optimization-based design is carried out for each selected location and the performances of the optimized building designs are systematically compared to the ones of the baseline models. The optimization results achieved show that regardless of the climate zone analyzed, using several PCMs with different melting temperatures instead of a single one, is preferred. Moreover, the best performance of PCMs is attained in climate zones where both the heating and cooling loads are present. Thus, the highest saving regarding the annual total loads of 11.7% is achieved in zone 5A (Cold), while the lowest one of 2.3% is obtained in zone 1B (Very hot). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:39:11","","","","","336","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120806","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; building; genetic algorithm; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Location; heating; Heat storage; Energy efficient building; Melting point; Phase change materials; temperature effect; Multi-objectives optimization; Storage (materials); In-buildings; Europe; Heating and cooling loads; energy storage; EnergyPlus; climate classification; Climate-representative location; Climate-representative locations; Energy-efficient building; greenhouse gas; Latent energy storage; Multiple melting; Multiple melting temperature; Multiple melting temperatures; Performance; Phase change material","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, through a critical review of previous studies, 19 different ways of using BIM logs were identified, including authoring and collaborative pattern discovery, authoring process modeling, collaboration pattern analysis, command predictions, and team optimization; however, most of the uses concerned process discovery. The analysis also revealed that BIM log mining has mainly been used for the design phase, with a few examples of being used for the construction phase. For BIM log mining, various techniques ranging from simple frequency analyses via social network analyses to advanced pattern discovery were deployed. In terms of BIM log sources, native BIM logs from Revit were dominantly used almost in all studies, aside from a few studies that used custom-developed BIM logs. The content analysis of BIM logs showed that the contents of native BIM logs provided by major BIM authoring tools varied, but commonly lacked model-element-specific information; this limitation prevents in-depth analyses of BIM processes. Overall, the current disproportionate focus on process discovery in the design phase of BIM log mining suggests that the application of BIM log mining is still in its early stages and holds significant potential for other project phases if adding model-element-specific information is incorporated. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:38:07","","","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.102079","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; building information modeling (BIM); BIM log; BIM log mining; Building information modeling log; Building information modeling log mining; Content analysis; Lexicon-based; Lexicon-based content analyse; Lexicon-based content analysis; Log mining; Supportability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reference standards do not consider the thermal adaptability of the human body, and HVAC system control strategies are based on a steady-state assumption that returns an incorrect estimate of occupants' thermal demand with a consequential misleading of the building energy consumption and of system sizing. To overcome these issues, a physiological thermal comfort model for the human body thermal behaviour evaluation is developed in MatLab environment for assessing the dynamic variation of the physiological parameters and for characterizing the occupants’ thermal sensation. Finally, the developed human body multi-node model is implemented in a building energy simulation tool (called DETECt 2.4) to perform three proposed strategies for the dynamic control of the building thermo-hygrometric parameters of the building and of the corresponding heating and cooling demands. These strategies provide an hourly regulation of relative humidity and air temperature by means of a two-step optimization that maximizes the thermal comfort of the occupants and minimizes energy consumption. To show the potentiality of the developed model, a suitable case study consisting of an office space is considered. Here, space heating and cooling demands obtained by applying the novel developed model are compared to those obtained through standard set-point values of air temperature and relative humidity (20 °C, 45% for heating needs, and 26 °C, 50% for cooling ones). By the comparison, between the proposed model – which considers the optimal hourly set point assessing the occupant in thermal evolution – and the reference ones, interesting results are obtained. Generally, a higher consumption is achieved by considering the proposed comfort strategies (from 2 to 16%), representing the price to be paid to maximize the comfort of the occupants and to annul the 3650 h of discomfort of the reference case. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:27","2024-02-20 10:28:23","","","","","173","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.113015","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Performance simulation; HVAC; Building energy performance; Thermal comfort; System Dynamics; Thermal comfort models; Behavioral research; Atmospheric temperature; MATLAB; Cooling; HVAC system; Space heating; Building energy performance simulation tool; Building energy performance simulation tools; Dynamic controls; Energy-saving control; Human bodies; Human body thermal adaptability; Human-body thermal sensation; HVAC system dynamic control; Optimal comfort and energy saving control of thermo-hygrometric property; Physiological models; Physiological thermal comfort model; Physiological thermal comfort models; Physiology; Property; Thermal adaptabilities; Thermal sensations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Semantically rich building information models (BIM) enable to perform an automated quantity take-off of the relevant elements for calculating a whole building life cycle assessment (LCA). However, imprecise type and property information often found in today's BIM practice hinders a seamless processing for downstream applications. At the same time, the early design stages are characterized by high uncertainty due to the lack of information and knowledge, making a holistic and consistent LCA for supporting design decisions and optimizing performance challenging. In assessing this often vague information, it is essential to consider different levels of element and material information for matching BIM to LCA data. For example, the structural properties of concrete are not yet defined in early design stages and should instead be considered as a range of material options due to different compressive strength classes. This paper presents a novel methodology for automatically matching the coarse information available in BIM models of the early design stages to the respective entries in LCA databases as a basis for a fully automated calculation process of the embodied GHG emissions of new buildings. This approach solves the existing gap in the automation process of manually enriching BIM models and adding information of LCA data and missing layers of vague models. In more detail, the proposed method is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), using different strategies to increase performance in matching elements and materials from a BIM model to a knowledge database to enrich environmental indicators of commonly used elements’ materials. The knowledge database contains all missing information for LCAs and has different levels of information for a range of several potential design options of elements and materials, including their dependencies. Accordingly, this paper investigates multiple NLP techniques and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models such as GermaNet, SpaCy, or BERT. Following this, the most performant NLP approach is used to provide an automatic workflow for matching Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) elements to the knowledge database, facilitating a seamless LCA in the early stages of design. For five different case studies, the performances of the proposed matching method are analyzed. Finally, one case study is selected to compare the embodied emissions results to those of the conventional process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:28","2024-02-20 10:32:07","","","","","284","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 8</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.112837","Architectural design; Automation; Structural design; Life cycle; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Building Information Modelling; BIM; Life cycle assessment; Deep learning; Intelligent buildings; Global warming; Early design stages; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Compressive strength; Natural language processing systems; LCA; Performance; Database systems; Early design stage; Greenhouse gas emissions; Language processing; Matchings; Model healing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; NLP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But quality diversity is not efficient in very expensive problems, needing hundreds of thousands of evaluations. Even with the assistance of surrogate models, quality diversity needs hundreds or even thousands of evaluations, which can make its use infeasible. In this study, we try to tackle this problem by using a pre-optimization strategy on a lower-dimensional optimization problem and thenmap the solutions to a higher-dimensional case. For a use case to design buildings that minimize wind nuisance, we show that we can predict flow features around 3D buildings from 2D flow features around building footprints. For a diverse set of building designs, by sampling the space of 2D footprints with a quality diversity algorithm, a predictive model can be trained that ismore accurate than when trained on a set of footprints that were selected with a space-filling algorithm like the Sobol sequence. Simulating only 16 buildings in 3D, a set of 1,024 building designs with low predicted wind nuisance is created.

Although the building industry shows significant signs of progress in this regard, frameworks aiming at the integration of comfort conditions remains one of the main points of contention. In recent years many studies have been carried out about the potential of window sizes to reduce energy consumption. However, the existing body of literature is lacking regarding various variables on visual comfort and consequently energy efficiency at the same time. Therefore, this research proposes a model to fill this gap in architectural regulations. Building on a genetic algorithm, the study develops and examines a novel multi-objective optimization model which can be adapted in the building design stage. The examined model leads to develop a standard strategy that can be used to evaluate visual comfort while maximizing energy performance in buildings with diverse functions and located in various climates. This model is formed from three main evaluation steps, which can be named project modeling according to the design stage, comfort assessment and evaluation, optimization and decision-making process. Therefore, based on the research limitation, window-to-wall ratio and types of glazing materials have been selected as optimization variables to examine the methodology. In this regard, the results show that the range between 20 and 50% can be considered acceptable in the examined office building located in Northern Cyprus. Although 20–40% clear glass makes an acceptable range of opening, the most preferred range is 30–50% of reflective glass, which proposes a bigger opening with the same amount of energy performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:28","2024-02-20 10:39:57","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106598","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Decision making; Office buildings; Construction industry; Building industry; Multiobjective optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Optimization method; Glazes; Climate models; Glass; Visual comfort; Comfort conditions; Window-to-wall ratio; Design stage; Glazing material; Glazing materials; Lighting quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An eight-storey office building in Beijing, 33.2 m high, 67.2 m long and 50.4 m wide, was selected as a case study building. First, a module was developed to transfer BIM in IFC format into BEM in EnergyPlus. Variable air volume systems were selected for the air system, while water-cooled chillers and boilers were used for the central plant. The EnergyPlus model calculated the heating and cooling loads for each space as well as the energy consumption of the central plant. Moreover, a chiller optimization module was developed to select the optimal chiller design for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. Fifteen available chillers were included, with capacities ranging from 471 kW to 1329 kW. The results showed that the cooling loads of the spaces ranged from 33 to 100 W/m2 with a median of 45 W/m2, and the heating load ranged from 37 to 70 W/m2 with a median of 52 W/m2. The central plant’s total cooling load under variable air volume systems was 1400 kW. Compared with the static load calculation method, the dynamic method reduced 33% of the chiller design capacity. When two chillers were used, different chiller combinations’ annual cooling energy consumption ranged from 10.41 to 11.88, averaging 11.12 kWh/m2. The lowest energy consumption was 10.41 kWh/m2 when two chillers with 538 kW and 1076 kW each were selected. Selecting the proper chiller number with different capacities was critical to achieving lower energy consumption, which achieved 12.6% cooling system energy consumption reduction for the case study building.

Balancing these two design aspects is extremely important in educational buildings where comfort conditions affect students' health and learning ability. Recent studies have shown a high sensitivity of adolescents and children towards lighting environment, proving the ability of better lighting conditions to improve students’ performance and general health. Admitting more daylight into classrooms can achieve the objectives of regulating students' circadian rhythms due to the proper amount, spectrum, and duration of daylight compared to electric light while minimizing energy use. This study uses multi-objective optimization to find the optimal classroom design in the cold, mixed-humid, hot-humid, and hot-dry climate zones of the U.S. The optimization objectives include minimizing energy use and maximizing the horizontal (desk-plane) and vertical (corneal or eye-plane) daylighting levels. Department of Energy (DOE) primary school building is used as a reference model. Results have shown that rectangular-south-oriented classrooms have the least energy use, while rectangular-north-oriented classrooms provide the highest and most uniform daylighting levels at the desk plane through the entire classroom and at least to the middle of the classroom at the eye-plane. Shallow classrooms with northeast- and southeast windows provide maximum daylighting levels at the eye-plane in the depth of the classroom. The classroom design with the best overall performance in all objectives has a rectangular plan and a northeast-oriented window. All optimal solutions have 3–5% higher window-to-wall ratio (WWR), higher window head height, and 5–8% less energy use than the reference classroom. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:28","2024-02-20 10:39:06","","","","","297","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113468","Architectural design; Structural design; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Daylighting; Multi-objectives optimization; Energy use; School buildings; Performance; Minimizing energy; Multi-objective optimization (MOO); Non visuals; Optimal classroom design; Optimal classrooms design; Students; U.S. Climate Zones; US climate zone; Visual and non-visual effect of light; Visual and non-visual effects of light; Visual effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the principle of equal heat flux intensity of the envelope, a simplified calculation method of the insulation thickness in each orientation is established. The relationship between each orientation insulation thickness can be simplified as a linear relationship. The influence characteristics between the factors like exterior surface, brick wall thickness, brick and insulation material and the orientation differential insulation thickness are obtained. Six typical cities in China are selected in combination with solar energy resource zones and building thermal divisions, and the insulation thickness of building envelope in each region is calculated. The results show that the orientation differential insulation design mode is suitable for solar energy resource zone I and zone II. Taking Lhasa as an example, compared with isotropic thermal insulation conditions, the material cost of thermal insulation layer under orientation differential insulation conditions is reduced by 24.6%, and the average heating energy consumption increases only by 6.1%. When the insulation material is the same, the average heating energy consumption can be reduced by 9.0%.

Climate change may cause these environmental stressors, like temperature intensity, to deviate from historical trends, implying that past design assumptions may not reflect future service conditions. Therefore, additional techniques are needed to associate the effects of climate on equipment service life. This paper develops a machine learning method capable of modeling complex building and environmental factors, including climate change, on the service life of equipment such as air-handling components. A boosted decision tree model is developed to predict equipment service life based on the combined impact of building and environmental factors. The developed model outperforms other approaches, such as industry-standard approaches, Weibull models, and inspection-based techniques for estimating equipment service life. The model showed a 93.9% reduction in mean-squared-error when estimating component service life compared to the industry standard model. The developed machine learning model is then combined with climate projection models to measure the impact of predicted temperature intensity changes on the service life of air-handling units, showing an expected 12%–41% decrease in the service life of air-handling units in Yuma, Arizona, when subjected to 2060 climate projections. © 2023","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:29","2024-02-20 10:38:33","","","","","234","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110192","Architectural design; architectural design; Structural design; machine learning; Forecasting; Machine learning; Machine-learning; numerical model; United States; computer simulation; climate change; ventilation; Climate models; Learning algorithms; Service life; Climate change; prediction; Machine learning models; air conditioning; Mean square error; climate effect; equipment; Environmental factors; Decision trees; Air-handling unit; Arizona; Climate projection; environmental factor; Environmental stressors; error analysis; Facility designs; Facility equipment; Facility maintenance; Industry standards; Machine components; Yuma County [Arizona]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The validation of this process occurs on a district scale in a social housing urban block located in Bologna (Italy), with currently poor environmental performance. A multi-criteria analysis was employed to examine the architectural, climatic, and energy context. The meta-design phase successfully attained the energy and economic targets set by the project and by local and European regulations settings, offering an optimized design solutions for reshaping the built environment. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:29","2024-02-20 10:28:30","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\YJUU89HD\Mazzoli et al. - 2023 - A Parametric Approach for Optimizing Design Soluti.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13123123","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Parametric design tools; Housing; Infill drilling; Environmental regulations; Bologna; Densifications; multi-criteria analysis; Multicriteria analysis; parametric design tools; Positive energies; positive energy district; Positive energy district; urban densification; Urban densification; urban infill; Urban infill; Volumetric addition; volumetric additions; Volumetrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the energy performance of PCM-enhanced building depends on several factors and the optimization of such factors using empirical building design is more difficult and sometimes even impossible. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method to consider multi-objectives, including building energy consumption, economic benefit, and carbon-saving. In this study, a non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA III) is coupled with a Stacking model to minimize building operational energy consumption (BOEC) and maximize life cycle economic benefit (LCEB) and life cycle carbon reduction (LCCR) simultaneously by finding the optimum configuration of PCM thickness, window-to-wall ratio, exterior glazing U-value and solar heat gain coefficient. The results show that the Stacking model combined with 8 heterogeneous machine learning models has the best performance for predicting energy consumption with a high correlation efficiency (R2 = 0.97). In addition, the building optimized with the Stacking-NSGA III framework shows a reduction of BOEC by 45.38 % and an increase of LCCR by 10.75 kg·CO2.e/m2. Moreover, the LCEB over a 50-year service life is 452.21 CNY/m2. It is believed that the proposed multi-objective optimization method can help stakeholders to find the most suitable PCM-building design strategies for their specific needs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:29","2024-02-20 10:39:01","","","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2023.107807","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Multi-objective optimization; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Operational energy; Phase change materials; Multi-objectives optimization; Climate change; Energy-consumption; Building operational energy consumption; Carbon reduction; Economic benefits; Life cycle carbon reduction; Life cycle economic benefit; Stacking models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study delves into the influences of these features on aspects such as sun-shading, ventilation, and heat insulation. By analyzing over ten Lingnan buildings in both the traditional and modern forms, several representative standardized models have been developed. Through a hybrid approach of combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies, including simulations, quantifications, and comparisons, several passive heat-protection measures commonly employed in Lingnan buildings were examined and evaluated. The effectiveness of shading, ventilation, and heat insulation in both traditional and modern buildings was assessed, resulting in the compilation of design principles for passive heat protection in buildings located in similar climatic zones. Key findings include (1) Shading: traditional methods reduce sunlight by 54.55%, while modern buildings enhance shading by applying new materials; (2) ventilation: traditional design achieves an outdoor wind speed of 1.5 m/s, improving thermal comfort, while modern Lingnan buildings optimize these principles; (3) insulation: traditional techniques maintain indoor temperatures below 26.0 °C, and modern buildings introduce innovation solutions for improved thermal insulation. In summary, traditional Lingnan design effectively addresses the challenges of the hot and humid climate by employing passive strategies for thermal comfort. Modern Lingnan buildings, in turn, preserve these principles while introducing innovative approaches. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:29","2024-02-20 10:05:29","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","","Architectural design; architectural design; Structural design; Wind; Traditional buildings; Natural ventilation; Ventilation; Thermal comfort; passive design; Thermal insulation; Indoor thermal comfort; Historic preservation; Hot and humid climate; Passive design; heat protection; Heat protection; Lingnan building; Lingnan buildings; Modern buildings; Protection designs; South China; thermal comfort","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their optimal designs, however, require consideration of various parameters and model complexity, making it challenging to solve multi-criteria problems and computationally intensive. This study aims to develop a data-driven two-phase optimization framework for exploring optimal BIES configurations. The novelties lie in 1) a co-simulation modelling and evaluation framework for BIES from both building and RES perspectives; 2) a two-phase workflow to decouple the complex BIES model and solve multi-criteria decision problems and 3) an artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model for rapid prediction. The proposed method is demonstrated using a prototype office building in a hot-summer and cold-winter area of China. The results show that RES-only optimization presents the lowest performances, necessitating the coordinated design for both building and RES sides. The simultaneous optimization method demonstrates the balanced quality for exploring both Pareto front and optimal solution, but encounters expensive computational costs (225 h) and convergence difficulty under 5000 optimization iterations. Comparatively, the proposed ANN-based two-phase optimization can achieve competitive solutions with half the computational time (90.6 h), which can be further reduced by efficient sampling methods. Overall, this study provides an optimization framework for holistically assessing and designing BIES that can approximate optimal configurations with significant computational savings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:29","2024-02-20 10:39:39","","","","","295","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113304","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Decision making; Office buildings; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Renewable energies; Energy systems; Data-driven model; Building integrated; Renewable energy system; Renewable energy systems; Building integrated energy system; Building integrated energy systems; Complex networks; Integrated energy systems; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criteria decision-making; Multi-phase optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that deep neural network (DNN) is the most efficient ML model with MAE, MSD and RMSE of 0.93, 1.12 and 1.06 respectively achieved in less than 7 s despite the huge data size.

Considering that construction constitutes one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of a building, there is an urgent desire to incorporate timber into this domain. Nevertheless, the use of timber faces inherent challenges stemming from its anisotropic nature, a result of the natural growth of timber fibers, which makes it challenging for it to function as a primary load-bearing material in coping with the various complex stresses inherent in architectural applications. Numerous designers have attempted to address this limitation through over-sized members and reinforcement at joints; however, none have satisfactorily resolved this issue in an economical manner. In this article, we introduce the Strut-and-Tie models (STM) from Graphic Statics (GS) and a topological optimization algorithm. This algorithm has the capability to generate a ‘load-minimizing path’ STM based on external load support conditions and the maximum structural path span. Regardless of the complexity of the initial external loads, each load transfer path in the optimized STM bears loads in only one direction, representing an optimal solution with minimal internal loads that align seamlessly with the characteristics of timber. Consequently, we endeavor to adopt this optimization algorithm to propose a structural design methodology, with the aspiration of designing structural systems that harness the unique attributes of timber perfectly and applying them to various architectural scenarios. Ultimately, we conclude that structural systems designed based on optimized STM are adaptable to diverse architectural contexts, and when applied to small-scale buildings, this method can save approximately 20% of material consumption compared to conventional timber frame structures, while in the case of mid-rise to high-rise buildings, it can lead to a material savings of approximately 5%. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:30","2024-03-12 16:16:44","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\E7HPJYBZ\Gao et al. - 2023 - Application of Graphic Statics and Strut-and-Tie M.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13122946","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization algorithms; Life cycle; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Structural systems; timber; Timber; Low carbon; Structure optimization; External loads; Graphic methods; graphic statics; Graphic statics; Model optimization; Structure design; structure optimization; Strut-and-tie model; strut-and-tie models; Timber structures; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 2_Timber; 3_Stress (Force); 1_Topology (unprefered example); 5_Others (Stairs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, such control may involve complex dynamics when dealing with passive energy technologies. In this paper, we focus on maximizing the passive operation of HVAC in a novel low-energy building design by means of Model Predictive Control (MPC). The low-energy building design, located in The Green Village, consists of a thermal chimney and solar shades over all-glass facades to provide the required indoor air conditioning as passively as possible. The MPC controller is based on a transient grey box model and a hierarchical control architecture to satisfy thermal comfort while minimizing the active energy requirements. Using sensor data collected from the actual building in April and May 2021, the grey box model shows a good agreement with the measurements, since the variance accounted for is 90% in most cases. Moreover, via a comparative study among different MPC architectures we show that managing the distinct transient response of each component (shades and chimney) is the best for successful overall performance – e.g. considering linear agents for shading and nonlinear agents for ventilation. The hierarchical MPC architecture established outperforms the standard ones by 22.7% in terms of control performance. We also compare the proposed MPC approach against the rule-based control method currently implemented in the actual building, which indicates that MPC demands about 78% less active energy, highlighting the proposed optimization-based control approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:30","2024-02-20 10:38:46","","","","","264","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.126177","Architectural design; Structural design; building; performance assessment; heating; HVAC; Ventilation; ventilation; Model predictive control; Glass; Predictive control systems; control system; All-glass facade; All-glass facades; And air-conditioning); Chimneys; Glass facades; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (heating; HVAC (Heating; Model-predictive control; MPC (Model predictive control); Passive energy; Solar shading; Solar shadings; Thermal chimney; Thermal chimneys; Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the research focused on segmented thin concrete shells as floor slabs, leveraging computational design and digital fabrication methodologies to automate their production off site. An important part of this research was the development of a computational framework for the design of thin concrete shells in order to make such a construction methodology accessible to building designers in practice. The framework combines solutions for parametric modelling, finite-element analysis, isogeometric analysis, form-finding and optimisation, along with embedded fabrication constraints specific to the project's automated manufacturing system.

Oxman classifies that a five-paradigmatic design model can help architects generate building forms. In this study, the authors aimed to develop a form-driven design framework based on a generative design model based on shape grammar that allows architects to generate building forms based on rules, which generate the building through variables that act as genes in the fitness function. The results indicate a significant framework that can help architects select the optimum building form that saves energy by enhancing daylight penetration and thermal and cooling loads on a building.

However, the post occupancy evaluation suggests many GB cannot well fulfill the expected targets. To overcome the mismatch among GB's multi-objectives, this paper develops an efficient and intelligent hybrid method using BIM-DesignBuilder (BIM-DB), Grey wolf optimization (GWO), random forest (RF) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to achieve the optimization of design parameters. The BIM model and DB simulation tool were used to obtain data samples of envelope and air conditioning system design parameters, and their life cycle carbon emission (LCCE), economic cost (EC) and predicted mean vote (PMV). The RF model was used to achieve high precision prediction. The GWO was used in the hyper-parameter optimization. The NSGA-II algorithm was applied to multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal design parameters. A building case shows: (1) The RF model had an excellent prediction performance for LCCE, EC and PMV. (2) BIM-DB can be used to obtain low error and high reliability building simulation data sets. (3) The RF-NSGA-II intelligent algorithm can reduce the LCCE of the building in the entire cycle by 16.6%, reduce the EC per square meter by 2.0%, and greatly improve the thermal comfort by 18.3%, representing good application value.

The simulations were conducted in Chongqing, comparing sixteen greening cases for determinant and enclosed building forms. Results indicate that the greening design for determinant layout should give priority to ensuring the greening area and shortening the distance from the sidewalk. While enclosed layout should concentrate greening in dense populations, using arbor–shrub–grass mix to improve the wind environment.

To optimize this type of structure while considering both optimization efficiency and structural reliability, an optimization method based on an improved DIviding RECTangle algorithm and combined response surface models is proposed herein. Firstly, the standardized section number of components with the same initial section dimension and material strength grade is treated as a variable. Each variable represents a dimension of the initial hyperrectangle, and the subdivision sequence is determined based on the design priority index. Subsequently, after each subdivision, potential optimal hyperrectangles are identified by evaluating the objective function value with constraint penalties at hyperrectangle center points and the distance from the points to the vertices. By continuously subdividing the potential optimal hyperrectangles, initial sampling points are obtained. Furthermore, combined response surface models for the objective and constraint functions are constructed. Finally, by continuously solving the sub-optimization problem to update the response surface models until the algorithm converges, the optimization of structural cost can be achieved. The case studies demonstrate that this method is capable of satisfying the structural constraints while efficiently optimizing the section dimension of high-rise building components. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:31","2024-03-25 11:49:08","","","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\JY9AXPTX\Jin et al. - 2023 - Research on section dimension optimization of high.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.105437","Architectural design; Concretes; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Geometry; Structural optimization; Optimization method; Steel-concrete composite; Surface properties; Combined response surface model; Composite buildings; Design priority index; Dividing rectangle algorithm; DIviding RECTangle algorithm; Dividing rectangles; High rise; High-rise steel–concrete composite building; High-rise steel–concrete composite buildings; Rectangles algorithms; Response surface modelling; Section dimension; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Composite (Concrete, Steel)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This layout is commonly used in office and residential buildings to reduce storey height and maximise natural daylighting. The core and lateral bracing of tall buildings is generally less sensitive to local failure than the secondary load transfer system provided by the floors and perimeter columns, considering the high vulnerability of perimeter columns to accidental actions and punching of the slab around the supports. This paper analyses sudden corner and edge column removal situations in slab-core-perimeter column systems using dimensions and loading representative of current tall building design and construction, looking at potential punching at the connections and flexural failure in the slab. The dynamic punching model previously developed by the authors, was validated in this work for further cases of punching around edge columns and slabs with low amount of flexural reinforcement. The dynamic punching model is based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory for quasi-static punching and the Ductility-Centred Robustness Assessment method. A simplified level of approximation is proposed for a preliminary dynamic punching check during the conceptual design stage to optimise the position columns and level of flexural and punching reinforcement needed. The approaches proposed are consistent with Model Code 2010 and can be used to arrest the horizontal propagation of failure in the slab. The analyses of the case studies in this work showed that removal of an edge column adjacent to a corner column can be critical and alternative robustness design considerations are needed in this case. © 2023","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:32","2024-02-20 10:42:06","","","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\5R9RYDS7\Garzón-Roca et al. - 2023 - Sudden column removal in tall buildings with flat .pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.104919","Architectural design; Buildings; Structural design; Tall buildings; Conceptual design; Concrete slabs; Reinforced concrete; Robustness; Alternative load path; Alternative load paths; Central core; Column removal; Core column; Edge columns; Failure; Failure (mechanical); Flat slabs; Perimeter column; Punching shear; Reinforced concrete flat slabs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such early decisions, which must be given in a short timeframe, have the largest impact on a project's quality, cost and embodied carbon. This study showed how much the conceptual design decisions affect the cost and carbon footprint of a building's structure using our Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II tool. First, we tested the tool's reliability by comparing its solutions with three case studies from literature. Then, we showed that by quickly examining various conceptual design solutions on a Pareto graph (which spotlights cost and CO2-optimized options), more sustainable design alternatives can be identified. Then, using the tool, we analyzed 36 building configurations, providing a spectrum of embodied carbon emissions (including the life cycle assessment steps A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, C2, C3, C4) ranging between 60 and 360 kgCO2e/m2. By comparing 25 material types from 15 databases (EPDs and ICE), we concluded that the geometry decisions (span length, height and shape) have the largest influence, material type (steel, timber, reinforced concrete), recycling and reuse of steel are crucial, and the embodied carbon calculations are highly sensitive to the supplier data and location. Overall, this study showed that architects and engineers possess the ability to significantly reduce the embodied carbon of structural systems by selecting the appropriate materials and structural system at the conceptual design stage. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:32","2024-03-19 12:48:17","","","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\4KVMSKPM\Kanyilmaz et al. - 2023 - How does conceptual design impact the cost and car.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.105102","Architectural design; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Conceptual design; Life cycle; Ecodesign; Multi-objective optimisation; Reinforced concrete; Construction industry; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Structural systems; Multiobjective optimization; Timber; Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Cost; Steel; Multi-objectives optimization; Early decision; Design decisions; Design impact; Mass timber; Material's type; Project quality; Quality costs; 3_Carbon; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 2_Timber","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The initial design – taken from a reference work – consists of an airflow driven by a fan through a copper tube bundle filled with PCM. Starting from this, a thermo-fluid dynamic 3D model is developed to assess the natural convection negligibility inside the PCM. Then, a 2D model is solved with a commercial finite element code and validated. Once the validation is assessed, this model is coupled with MATLAB® to perform the multi-objective optimization procedure. Optimal system configurations (tube diameter, thickness, pitches) and operational variables (fan velocity, cycle time, PCM melt temperature) are achieved on a 3D Pareto surface that collects the non-dominated solutions, i.e., minimizing costs and pressure drop (air side), and maximizing the average storage rate. The 3D Pareto approach enables to find solutions that outperform the initial configuration, i.e., the average storage rate is increased by 28.4%, simultaneously improving the other two objective functions. Finally, two sub-optimal solutions from the 2D fronts are numerically compared to show the difference in the air stream distribution across the new tubes’ arrangement and the PCM melting evolution.

However, these buildings have been seriously damaged in the long history. To inherit and reflect the national characteristics and regional culture, the modern Chinese traditional-style building (MCTB) is newly developed to imitate the appearance of Chinese ancient timber architecture. The base metal of the typical joint area in MCTBs is always fractured under earthquakes because of its rigid characteristics, which is difficult to repair once damaged. To prevent joint failure and improve reparability after earthquakes, steel semi-rigid friction-damped joints with replaceable angles in MCTBs are proposed. Four specimens were fabricated and tested under lateral cyclic loading. The test results showed that the failure of all specimens is mainly concentrated in the weak region of the replaceable angles. Compared with simple semi-rigid joints, the yield displacements of specimens with friction dampers (including shear damper and rotational damper) are obviously larger, and the strength, initial stiffness, cumulative energy dissipation and replaceable capacity are significantly improved.

Therefore, wind loads must be adequately evaluated in the design of tall buildings. Aerodynamic modifications are highly effective tools for reducing wind loads. This paper investigates the effectiveness of corner modification optimization applied on an octagonal-plan-shaped model using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation computational fluid dynamics associated with finite element analysis to alleviate wind-induced loads. Corner aerodynamic modifications such as chamfered, recessed, rounded, and fins are investigated. The corner modification was limited to a cutting radius of 6 m (12% of the building width) with a 0.5 m increment. The main considerations for this optimization procedure are top deflection, inter-story drifts, and the optimal number of additional floors. All corner modifications improve the building's performance, except fins corners resulting in adverse effects. In addition, 47 simulation examples from the case study are evaluated, presented, and discussed. With one additional floor, the optimum shape was able to reduce overall wind loads by 31.67%, resulting in a reduction in the structural response of 24.89% and 24.18% in maximum top deflection and inter-story drift, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:32","2024-03-12 13:50:27","","","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\D8IHRK4U\Al-Masoodi et al. - 2023 - Aerodynamic optimization for corner modification o.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107017","Architectural design; Floors; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind load; Wind stress; Optimization; Aerodynamic loads; Interstory drifts; Aerodynamics; Computational approach; Computational fluid dynamics; CFD; Fins (heat exchange); Aerodynamic drag; Aerodynamic modifications; Aerodynamics optimizations; Corner modifications; Drag; Effective tool; Lateral load resisting systems; Octagonal shapes; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 2_Others (Not Specified); 3_Stiffness (top deflection)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The construction of tall buildings results in a high temporal and spatial concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is largely due to the compounding influence of wind and earthquake loads on structural material requirements. Thus, to meet short-term climate change mitigation goals, the structural design of tall buildings must consider and minimise the embodied GHG emissions of structural systems. This study aimed to develop a framework to inform the design of tall building structural systems in order to minimise their embodied GHG emissions. A software tool was developed to implement the framework and automate the design, analysis, and embodied GHG emissions assessment of structural systems for tall buildings. Approximately 1,000 building models were iteratively designed, analysed, and assessed using the software tool. Through regression analyses, the resulting dataset was used to construct predictive models for the embodied GHG emissions of 12 unique combinations of structural system typologies and materials. By applying the framework and software tool to a 52-storey case study building, it is estimated that optimising structural material choices and geometric design strategies could reduce the embodied GHG emissions of tall building structural systems by up to 20% compared to current practices. The developed framework and software tool allow designers to use environmental assessment as a design decision-making tool, rather than an appraisal method for evaluating completed buildings, helping to reduce the environmental effects associated with tall building construction. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:33","2024-02-20 10:37:20","","","","","297","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113462","Architectural design; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Structural design; Tall buildings; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; Construction industry; Regression analysis; Structural systems; Life cycle assessment; Climate change; Design decision-making; Computer software; Greenhouse gas emissions; Adverse effect; Building structural; Effects of materials; Premium for height; Software-tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An efficient ventilation system is necessary for improving the indoor thermal environment and air quality in utility tunnels.

The results show that the WAV scheme offers a higher ventilation efficiency, while decreasing the age of air and providing a uniform air distribution. Thus, the WAV scheme is recommended for utility tunnel ventilation systems. Additionally, the WAV scheme is further optimized and analysed based on response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of different factors (i.e., the slot outlet height (h), slot outlet width (b), air-supply velocity (u0), and cable heat source intensity (q)) on the evaluation indicators is studied, and the optimal design scheme (h = 1.40 m, b = 0.12 m, u0 = 3.00 m/s, q = 74.5 W/m2) is obtained and verified.

Therefore, generalized regression neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-GRNN) based surrogate model was constructed, and a multi-objective optimization framework based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and GA-GRNN surrogate model updating was proposed. The feasibility of multi-objective optimization framework based on surrogate model updating was verified by using the experimental wind pressure data of a supertall building model, and the influencing factors of optimization efficiency were analyzed. The results show that the proposed framework has satisfactory optimization accuracy and efficiency. The optimal sample data set proportional distribution (training set: verification set: test set, i.e., T: V: T) is 7:2:1. With the increase of the total number of sample points in the design space, the optimal proportion of the initial sample points decreases significantly. A thorough consideration of the acquisition time of a single sample value and the optimal proportion of initial sample points is helpful to improve the multi-objective optimization efficiency further. Therefore, for the optimization problems in engineering applications (especially supertall buildings), it is suggested that the reasonable proportion of initial sample points of the surrogate model should be determined according to the acquisition time of a single sample value and the total number of sample points in the design space. The framework is more suitable for complex problems with large total number of sample points in design space and long acquisition time of a single sample value.

To drive and realize the energy saving design and achieve carbon emission and thermal comfort optimization of NZEBs, in this paper, an intelligent optimization method integrating the BIM-DB and PSO-RF-NSGA-III method is established. Multiobjective optimization problems involving NZEBs in four typical climate regions in China are explored. With a typical office building as an example, first, simulation calculations regarding the energy consumption, carbon emissions and indoor thermal comfort in the four climatic regions are performed based on orthogonal tests and BIM-DB. Second, the nonlinear mapping relationships between building design parameters and prediction targets are constructed with the PSO-RF model, which is trained with sample data. The obtained nonlinear mapping relations are used to establish the objective function of NSGA-III, and the multiobjective Pareto-optimal solution set is obtained with the developed PSO-RF-NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, the only optimal solution is determined by using the ideal point method, and reference near-zero-energy-consumption office building parameters are calculated for different climate regions. The conclusions are as follows. (1) The PSO-RF algorithm can efficiently predict building energy consumption, carbon emissions and thermal comfort. In the four regions, the goodness of fit of the three targets is greater than 0.94. (2) Multiobjective optimization can be performed with the proposed RF-NSGA-III intelligent optimization method. After optimizing multiple groups of optimization schemes and adopting energy saving measures, the energy consumption levels in the four climate regions are reduced by 39.72 %, 32.22 %, 26.94 % and 35.37 %, and the other goals are optimized.

Machine learning analysis is performed for predicting power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a dependent variable and molecular descriptors as independent factors. Moreover, similarity analysis (Tanimoto similarity) is used to screen structures based on the similarity between structures present in the databases and reference (given) structures.

Particularly in the early stages of design process, the spatial configuration cannot be overlooked and it has a significant impact on the functional performance of a building. Existing research on healthcare facility layout design focused on the methods of simulation, procedural and algorithmic approaches with limited consideration of building operational performance, or the well-being of future occupants. In light of this, this article proposes a systematic decision-support approach that combines multi-objective optimization and simulation-based occupancy performance evaluation to offer a well-performance healthcare facility layout solution. The mathematical model's purpose is to optimize building operational objectives, namely, minimizing resource transportation costs and maximizing adjacent requirements between facilities. Then the performance of the mathematical model's Pareto solutions is evaluated using a simulation module that takes user-building interactions into account. To further validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a comparative experiment involving three healthcare architects in the design of a surgical ward layout. Results indicate that the proposed approach can assist architects in achieving a balance between efficiency and safety in healthcare facility layout design, resulting in a more occupant-centric building design. Moreover, this systematic approach provides the theoretical basis on describing how to integrate the widely researched models for architectural layout planning and occupancy performance evaluation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:33","2024-02-20 10:28:39","","","","","77","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107465","Architectural design; Structural design; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Decision support systems; Decision supports; Simulation; Multi-objectives optimization; Health care; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Performance; Facilities layout design; Healthcare facility; Healthcare facility layout design; Occupancy performance; Performances evaluation; User-building interaction; User-building interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed approach combined Monte Carlo simulations with a genetic algorithm for stochastic design optimization considering uncertainty in carbon emission factors. Based on a “cradle to site” system boundary that considers the production, transportation, and construction of reinforcement, concrete, and formwork, a case study of a continuous beam was conducted. The results revealed the significance of carbon emission factor choices on the optimal solutions. Further parametric analyses indicated the rational ranges of sectional dimensions and material strengths from a probabilistic perspective, and suggestions were accordingly proposed for low-carbon design alternatives. Overall, the choices of emission factors can change the values of objective functions in the optimization, and therefore, affect the optimized design parameters of reinforced concrete beams. © 2022 fib.

The early design stages have high impact on the final performance of the buildings and are characterized by high uncertainty due to the lack of information and not yet taken decisions. Furthermore, most current LCA approaches based on Building Information Models (BIM) require high expertise and experience in both BIM and LCA and do not follow an intuitive visualization approach for other stakeholders and non-experts. This paper presents a novel design-decision-making approach for reducing embodied GHG emissions by interactive, model-based visualizations of uncertain LCA results. The proposed workflow is based on open BIM data formats, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and BIM Collaboration Format (BCF), and is developed for decision support for non-LCA experts in the early design stages. With the help of a user study, the prototypical implementation is tested by 103 participants with different levels of experience in BIM and LCA based on a case study. We evaluate the proposed approach regarding the support of open BIM data formats, different LCA visualization strategies, and the intuitiveness of different approaches to visualizing uncertain LCA results. The user study results show a broad acceptance and need for open BIM data formats and model-based LCA visualization but less for visualizing uncertainties, which needs further research. In conclusion, this interactive, model-based visualization approach using color coding supports non-LCA experts in the design decision-making process in early design stages. © 2023 The Authors","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:33","2024-02-20 10:31:58","","","","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dibe.2023.100263","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; Building Information Modelling; BIM; Decision support systems; Life cycle assessment; Early design stages; Design decision-making; LCA; Visualization; Data visualization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Design decision support; Design decision supports; Interactive models; Model-based OPC; Modeling data; Open buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagrid is the widespread type of tube system and consists of a diagonal grid of beams that wraps the building, forming a diamond pattern. It performs as lateral bracing and is additionally able to sustain vertical loading through axial forces. Despite its efficiency, a growing interest is recently observed in alternative geometries to replace the diagrid pattern and improve the architectural impact conferred by the building skin aesthetics on the urban environment. The paper pursues the use of a Voronoi mesh, in which the geometry of the cells is steered to known schemes for the structural design of a cantilever tube structure. The objective is to mimic a macroscopic structural behavior through a topology and size modification of the Voronoi mesh that increases the density for creating resisting paths with higher stiffness. The paper proposes a novel method Vorogrid for designing a new class of tall buildings equipped with an organic-looking and mechanically sound tube structure, which makes them a valuable alternative to competitors (diagrid, hexagrid, random Voronoi). Diagrids and hexagrids still remain more efficient in terms of forces and displacements but are characterized by a more usual appearance, instead Vorogrid offers more design control and better performances on average with respect to random Voronoi structures. This method is streamed into a pipeline that includes grid initialization strategies, geometric and structural optimization to mitigate the effects of the grid randomness, and structural sizing. © 2022 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:33","2024-03-26 10:13:30","","683-701","","6","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\K6NQSJ2P\Laccone et al. - 2023 - Vorogrid A static-aware variable-density Voronoi .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mice.12912","Architectural design; multistorey building; optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; design; Building design; Structural optimization; structural analysis; topology; Tube systems; Tubes (components); geometry; Axial forces; Diamond patterns; Its efficiencies; Lateral bracing; Mesh generation; stiffness; Tube-structure; Variable density; Vertical loadings; Voronoi; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stress; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Topology (interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam.

Design/methodology/approach: Integration of physics-based simulation tools and decision-making tools such as Multi-Attribute Utility (MAU) and Interactive Multi-objective Optimization (IMO) in the design process enable optimized design decision-making for high-performing buildings. A methodology is presented for improving building adaptation design decision making, specifically in the early-stage design feasibility analysis. Ten residential building adaptation strategies are selected and applied to one primary building system for eight performance metrics using physics-based simulation tools. These measures include energy use, thermal comfort, daylighting, natural ventilation, systems performance, life cycle, cost-benefit and constructability. The results are processed using MAU and IMO analysis and are validated through sensitivity analysis by testing one design strategy on three building systems. Findings: Quantifiable comparison of building adaptation strategies based on multiple metrics derived from physics-based simulations can assist in the evaluation of overall environmental performance and economic feasibility for building adaptation projects. Research limitations/implications: The current methodology presented is limited to the analysis of one decision-maker at a time. It can be improved to include multiple decision-makers and capture varying perspectives to reflect common practices in the industry. Practical implications: The methodology presented supports affordable generation and analysis of a large number of design options for early-stage design optimization.

This paper addresses that problem by studying one ubiquitously used search strategy - Bayesian optimization (BO) - on a 2D test problem with modifiable convexity and difficulty. Specifically, we test how providing diverse versus non-diverse initial samples to BO affects its performance during search and introduce a fast ranked-determinantal point process method for computing diverse sets, which we need to detect sets of highly diverse or non-diverse initial samples. We initially found, to our surprise, that diversity did not appear to affect BO, neither helping nor hurting the optimizer's convergence. However, follow-on experiments illuminated a key trade-off. Non-diverse initial samples hastened posterior convergence for the underlying model hyper-parameters - a model building advantage. In contrast, diverse initial samples accelerated exploring the function itself - a space exploration advantage. Both advantages help BO, but in different ways, and the initial sample diversity directly modulates how BO trades those advantages. Indeed, we show that fixing the BO hyper-parameters removes the model building advantage, causing diverse initial samples to always outperform models trained with non-diverse samples. These findings shed light on why, at least for BO-type optimizers, the use of diversity has mixed effects and cautions against the ubiquitous use of space-filling initializations in BO. To the extent that humans use explore-exploit search strategies similar to BO, our results provide a testable conjecture for why and when diversity may affect human-subject or design team experiments.  © 2023 by ASME.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:33","2024-02-20 10:36:46","","","","11","145","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\RP59W8PR\Kamrah et al. - 2023 - How Diverse Initial Samples Help and Hurt Bayesian.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4063006","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; machine learning; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Design optimization; design optimization; Design of experiments; Metamodeling; Bayesian optimization; Statistical tests; Bayesian; Design researchers; Hyper-parameter; metamodeling; Model buildings; Optimizers; Quantitative prediction; Search strategies; Space research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The criteria for a more comprehensive sustainable approach are related to environmental, constructive, and durability aspects. The environmental factor is measured through CO2 emissions, considering its capture due to concrete carbonation. The use of multi-objective strategies is evident in solving the multi-criteria problem. Still, it is also proposed to formulate this problem with a single function containing all the criteria to solve it as a single-objective optimization problem. Strategies are also offered to perform multi-objective optimization based on Kriging metamodels. Several alternatives for multi-criteria decision-making are explored. The results show that multi-objective metamodel-based optimization is a good strategy for solving this problem. Alternatively, the results of the single-objective optimization of the multi-criteria problem are very satisfactory. The solutions obtained are analyzed according to the type of optimization and the decision-making criteria. Optimized solutions significantly improve the sustainability indexes compared to traditional design. Multi-criteria optimization contributes significantly to achieving these indexes. Therefore, the proposed methodology allows for the sustainable design of any reinforced concrete frame structure. It highlights the importance of integrating more encompassing formulations and advanced optimization techniques into traditional design procedures to adopt cleaner production practices in the construction sector.

However, it is more cumbersome for reinforced concrete buildings with infill walls due to their nonlinear behavior. The objective of this study is to highlight the importance of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models to achieve the best performance in predicting the fundamental period of infilled RC frame buildings. To this end, three types of boosting algorithms have been chosen, namely: gradient boosting decision trees, lightGBM, and catboost. Compared to the default parameters for each model, the fine-tuning hyperparameter models with the Optuna framework yielded the best results, with a higher coefficient of determination and lower error values. Furthermore, the lightGBM model set by its optimized parameters outperformed the other two boosting methods. The feature selection technique emphasizes the five parameters’ contributions in estimating the building's fundamental period by demonstrating the effect of removing one or more parameters each time on determining this dynamic characteristic. Moreover, the multivariate adaptive regression splines is used to develop a mathematical expression for the fundamental period that outperformed building code formulas and some authors’ proposed equations.

To evaluate and optimize building design decisions, holistic performance metrics are needed. This work defines a novel quantitative assessment framework of indoor air quality (IAQ) resilience which output is the resilience score (RS) metric that integrates all resilience aspects and building-relevant pollutants. The framework was demonstrated via simulations on a validated model of a case study educational building in Belgium for 3 ventilations systems: constant air volume (CAV), demand-controlled ventilation (DCV), DCV without filters, and 3 shock types (mechanical MS, internal IS, outdoor shocks OS). Results showed that OS was the least critical shock type, followed by IS and MS. With increasing degree of shock, RSMS decreased for all 3 systems linearly by 64% until 2.8 h of power outage, beyond which the rate of decrease slowed down considerably.

Such work often involves complex analysis of urban geometry and non-uniform irradiance conditions for dynamic shading. This paper presents a novel method for comprehensive evaluation and optimization of building design with integrated photovoltaics. Key parameters include building-height-to-street-width ratio (H/W), number-of-floors (Nf), aspect ratio (r), floor area (Af), window-wall ratio (WWR), and photovoltaics’ tilt angle on façades (β). The developed model has been validated experimentally. A baseline model was produced to further highlight the differences between EUI with and without surrounding buildings. Results showed that H/W and Nf were positively correlated with deviations with Af. Higher Af and Nf improved energy efficiency especially for low-to-mid rises. Heating and cooling presented no correlation with Nf for r≥5, while both loads reached peaks at r=4. As H/W increased, heating proportionately increased by 2.1 kWh/m2 while cooling decreased by 1.8 kWh/m2. These rates dropped as H/W increased. Energy production from façades increased when r>2, with a slope of 10,000 kWh per unit, and a variance of 190,000 kWh. The effect of β shows higher significance in cooling, heating, and production, especially for low H/W. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:34","2024-02-20 10:39:19","","","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2023.103124","Architectural design; architectural design; Floors; optimization; Structural design; carbon emission; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Building design; Aspect ratio; energy efficiency; Cooling; Building integrated photovoltaic; energy balance; urban area; Building densities; Building integrated photovoltaics; correlation; Dynamic shading; Geometric constraint; Multivariate optimization; Photovoltaics; Urban building density; Urban buildings; urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During their lifespans, buildings consume embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE). Building professionals, therefore, conduct life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) to quantify and understand the paradox and interconnectedness between EE and OE. Traditionally, simulation-based optimization techniques were used for design space exploration to identify a building design with the fewest energy implications. However, literature shows these data-driven approaches are often error-prone, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, and they fail to provide real-time feedback to the user. Moreover, EE and OE assessment tools are disjointed and suffer from interoperability issues. These limitations restrict design space exploration, which eventually hinders the design decision-making process. Over the last few years, the increased availability of building data has made machine learning (ML) techniques a popular choice for building performance assessments. Several articles have developed prediction models to assess or optimize OE. While this work is significant, studies utilizing ML techniques for building LCEA are lacking, mainly due to the unavailability of a large-scale LCEA database. In this paper, we propose a methodology to (1) generate a simulation-based building energy dataset for different building typologies using a parametric framework, (2) utilize the synthetically generated database to develop an ML-based prediction model to predict EE and OE, and (3) test the model using a case study. The case study results show that the model achieves high prediction performance using minimal inputs available during the early design phase. The results further indicate that ML techniques can be used by building designers with no or limited LCE expertise to instantaneously estimate building LCE performance and help them select design options with minimal LCE consumption. © 2023","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:34","2024-02-20 10:42:29","","","","","297","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113444","Architectural design; Structural design; Optimization; Life cycle; Decision making; Construction industry; Forecasting; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Carbon footprint; Embodied energy; Life cycle energies; Building life cycle; Energy assessment; Life cycle energy; Building performance analysis; Building load; Statistical tests; Building life cycle energy assessment; Building load prediction; Load predictions; Operating energies; Operating energy; Supervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors refer to this methodology as Universal Design Space Exploration (UDSE). Rather than apply DSE to a project-specific challenge, UDSE enables a single pre-simulated design space to be applicable across many projects. The novel scalability of these “universal” design spaces justify investment in ML-powered apps that make pre-simulated analysis instantly accessible, affordable, and impactful across multiple projects. This research showcases the feasibility and potential benefit of UDSE by applying it to the challenge of early conceptual energy modeling. First, a group of experts crafts the input parameters and output metrics of a massive Design Space so that it encompasses the common problem. Then an automated parametric simulation workflow is developed to model and simulate any combination of input parameters. Several hundred thousand iterations are then simulated and analyzed. The result of this analysis guides the design of a prototype app which is powered by an AI surrogate model that allows users to receive instantaneous analysis about any design contained within the design space. This research shows that it is feasible to simulate the massive design spaces required by UDSE using currently available computational resources. We show that the surrogate modeling process is capable of accurately extending relatively limited simulation data to fully map the design space. We also show that these surrogate models can be effectively integrated into custom apps that can automate advanced DSE analysis and deliver insights to design teams in real-time. This paper concludes that UDSE offers a novel and scalable approach to early conceptual performance analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:34","2024-02-20 10:42:37","","","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.105977","Architectural design; Structural design; Building design; Design space exploration; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Investments; Surrogate modeling; Energy; Work-flows; Input parameter; Design spaces; Performances analysis; Universal Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new structure is assembled by graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) in parallel to form a building block (GDY/BP/GDY).

Many researchers have emphasized the need for design strategies that establish a direct correlation between design proposals and building performance. One of the main objectives is to support performance-driven primary design, which occurs before the design performance modeling (DPM) phase. To achieve this, a case study of retrofitting existing buildings on campus is presented. A normative calculation approach is used to identify the optimal combinations of a dozen retrofit strategies based on the Energy Performance Calculator (EPC) model. This approach reduces or eliminates the impact of parametric uncertainties on modeling assumptions and simplifies calculations, particularly in restrictive studies. These retrofit solutions involve structural and functional zoning renovation, meaning that disparity between expectations and fulfilments is considered, and a timely related information feedback route to architects is achieved. In the first step of the narrative development of the EPC model, EPC-Calib was used to find the optimal combination of input variables in the model that satisfies the desired target and complies with the problem constraints. Secondly, the retrofit study was implemented with EPC-TechOpt, and 16 retrofit solutions for three design performance models were examined based on the local climatic conditions, building features, and retrofit costs.

However, BPS models often have high computational costs, which is particularly limiting for applications that require a significantly large number of simulations, such as building design optimization or uncertainty analyses. To overcome this gap, researchers have turned to surrogate modeling, where a mathematical model, such as a machine learning algorithm, is trained to mimic the performance of a BPS, allowing to test numerous building design/operation configurations at low computational costs. Past studies have applied surrogate BPS modeling to predict the impact of building design parameters on energy performance. However, few have considered building operational parameters, such as occupancy, equipment and lighting usage, and thermostat setpoints, which significantly impact energy consumption and peak loads, especially in harsh climate conditions. This paper presents a unique evaluation and comparison of machine learning algorithms as surrogates to BPS predictions of building performance (energy consumption and peak loads) under different operational settings. Results indicate that Extreme Gradient Boosting outperformed all other methods in predictive accuracy, with R2 values reaching as high as 0.99 for some models. In contrast, linear regression models were the fastest to train and easiest to interpret while still achieving competitive prediction accuracies (R2 values > 0.9). This work provides direct evidence of the machine learning surrogate models' ability to accurately predict building performance under different operational settings. It also offers unique insights into the strengths and weaknesses of white-box and black-box predictive modeling approaches and the effect of dataset size on the results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:35","2024-02-20 10:38:21","","","","","286","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 7</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.112940","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Building design; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Regression analysis; Building performance simulations; Energy utilization; Computational costs; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty analysis; Learning algorithms; Energy consumption; Building performance simulation; Energy-consumption; Machine learning algorithms; Energy peaks; Ensemble learning; Peak load; Peak loads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(3) In the MOO task, the consideration of model and data uncertainty by prediction intervals and Monte-Carlo simulation can further increase the optimization rate by around 4.0% than the deterministic scenario, resulting in more desired strategies in optimizing the green building performance. In short, this paper enriches the area of green building development. For one thing, it raises the transparency and interpretability of machine learning to make the prediction more convincing. For another, it efficiently determines the passive and active design solutions along with the detailed profile of influential factors for green building design. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:35","2024-02-20 10:31:56","","","","","333","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 14</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120575","Architectural design; architectural design; optimization; Structural design; algorithm; Energy efficiency; machine learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Pareto principle; Air conditioning; Building energy performance; Multi-objectives optimization; Monte Carlo methods; Green building design; energy planning; Intelligent systems; Bayesian optimization; Shapley; Ensemble learning; Ensemble Learning; Learning objectives; Model explanation; Multi-objective Optimization; Optimization rates; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These decisions have a major impact on the comfort conditions and energy performance of buildings. Balancing daylighting levels in school buildings with the energy use is essential due to the physiological, psychological, and behavioral effects of daylight on human body, known as the non-image forming (NIF) effects of light, as well as its impact on the energy use. This study uses multi-objective optimization (MOO) to find the optimal classroom design that has the best overall performance in terms of daylighting levels at the horizontal desk-plane for image-forming (IF) or visual benefits, daylighting at the vertical eye-level for NIF benefits, and the total energy use of classrooms. The study optimizes two classrooms connected to double-loaded corridor from the Department of Energy (DOE) primary school reference building. The optimization parameters include the classroom geometry (width, depth, and height), the window dimensions (width and head height), and the orientation. The impact of the location factor is explored by optimizing the same model in the mixed-humid, hot-humid, hot-dry, and cold climate zones of the U.S. The results indicate that the 3:2 width-to-depth plan shape in most optimal solutions performs better than the 5:4 width-to-depth plan of the reference model. Accordingly, wider windows and higher head height in the optimal design were able to allow more daylighting to the depth of the oppositely oriented classrooms while reducing the energy use. The results show that optimal classrooms’ design connected to double-loaded corridors, including window dimensions, orientation, and window to wall ratio (WWR) vary by the climate zone or location. © 2023","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:35","2024-02-20 10:36:05","","","","","298","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113562","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Multiobjective optimization; Daylighting; Behavioral research; Building envelope design; Energy use; Performance; Optimal classroom design; US climate zone; Computer aided instruction; Daylight performance; Double-loaded corridor; Double-Loaded corridors; Head height; Image forming; Learning environments; U.S. climate zones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of expounding the principle of compound negative pressure ventilation, firstly, the feasibility of negative pressure ventilation in improving the air quality of classrooms is verified through actual measurement.

TRNSYS was used to build the simulation model for a near-zero-energy building and its air conditioning system in Beijing. The Taguchi method was used to sort the design parameters that affect system performance according to the degree of influence and find the best combination of design parameters to optimize the system, which increased the solar fraction of the system by 4.6% and reduced the annual operating energy consumption by 7.32%. For the optimized system, a multi-objective optimization function of the life cycle costs and carbon emissions was established. By comparing the energy consumption, life cycle costs, and carbon emissions of the air conditioning system under different system configurations, optimal configuration solutions under different design target weights were obtained. It was found that using a ground source heat pump system + solar collector system had better energy-savings benefits, but the operating costs were slightly higher. The application of absorption refrigeration can reduce the system operating costs but will increase the initial investment. The best economic benefits were achieved using the ground source heat pump system + solar collector system for heating in winter and the ground source heat pump system for cooling in summer, and the best environmental benefits were obtaining using the ground source heat pump system + solar collector system for heating in winter and the ground source heat pump system + solar absorption refrigeration system in summer, which provides a reference for the optimization design and research of air conditioning systems in near-zero energy buildings. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:36","2024-02-20 10:05:36","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Investments; Energy conservation; Air conditioning; Heat-pump systems; Geothermal heat pumps; Operating costs; Zero energy buildings; Renewable energies; HVAC system; Conditioning systems; Collector systems; ground source heat pump; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); operating characteristics; Operating characteristics; Operating energy consumption; optimal configuration; Optimal configuration; Optimization researches; renewable energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital technologies such as building performance simulation and optimization algorithms have been used to identify optimal retrofit schemes, yet the existing approaches are limited by the slow running speed of physics-based models and sub-optimal results. This study describes a novel framework, the Building Performance Optimization using Artificial Neural Network (BPO-ANN), which can automatically identify optimal building retrofit schemes. A robust Artificial Neural Network model was developed and validated as a surrogate to rapidly assess building performances, which was then connected to a genetic algorithm in search of Pareto optimal. The impact of key design attributes on building performances have been assessed using sensitivity analysis. The BPO-ANN framework has been tested in a high-performing campus building in Northern China under two competing objectives: building energy demand and occupant thermal comfort. It can automatically identify optimal design schemes, which were expected to achieve an energy-savings of 4% and reduce the annual thermal discomfort percentage by 4%. Sensitivity analysis suggested that window-to-wall ratio and HVAC setpoint have contributed the most to the performances of the campus building, followed by the roof U-value and wall U-value. The study has contributed methodologically to simulation-based optimization method, with novelties in the use of neural network algorithms to accelerate the otherwise time-consuming physics-based simulation models.

Natural ventilation helps reduce the energy and carbon of mechanical ventilation but remains a challenge, especially in high-density cities and global warming. This study aims to explore the potential of passive underground ventilation in high-density modern cities, which contributes to alleviating potential conflicts between health and energy. As a historic and widespread method, passive ventilation improves the climate adaptation and energy efficiency of building forms while introducing natural elements to improve physical and psychological health. This paper reviews the representative cases and studies on passive ventilation in traditional underground buildings and analyses their principles and problems using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Further, this paper proposes design highlights and space prototypes for ‘space–airflow’ coupling from multiscale spaces. The design highlights include the following: 1) urban scale: urban wind corridors and downdraught from the ground/overhead; 2) site scale: microclimate and coupling layout between the pressure difference and the air inlet/outlet; 3) building scale: integrated layout of ventilation and functional spaces; and 4) room scale: ventilation mode and efficiency. The CFD results indicate that optimising the layout and form of spaces effectively enhances the natural ventilation. These findings were previously obscured and overlooked in urban design and architectural design.

However, a large number of expensive simulation runs is usually required to complete a Building Performance Optimization (BPO) process with a high confidence of the optimal solutions. Although evolutionary algorithms have been enhanced with surrogate models, complex BPO problems with many design variables still require a prohibitive number of expensive simulations, or lead to solutions with related low accuracy. Hence, performing multi-objective optimizations of actual building designs is still one of the most challenging problems in building energy design. A novel efficient multi-objective algorithm for expensive models based on a probabilistic approach is presented in this work. The new algorithm reduces the computational time needed for the optimization process, while increasing the quality of the solutions found. The algorithm was tested on the optimization problem of three groups of analytical test functions and on the BPO problem related to the refurbishment of three reference buildings. For the latter case, the efficiency, efficacy, and quality of the Pareto solutions found with the proposed algorithm were compared with the true Pareto front previously sought with a brute force approach. The results show that, for the most complex case among the three reference buildings, the algorithm can find about 50 % of the solutions on the true Pareto front with 100 % accuracy.

This platform serves as a starter for a common language of these two professions in the early stages of design. Architects can use this platform to produce the final topological optimized form by defining their shape plans, lateral loads, height, and the target ratio of models as platform inputs. This paper highlights the importance of the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method simultaneously in architectural and structural contexts to reduce the total weight of the structure while keeping the displacement of the structure in an acceptable range. The reduction will be made by eliminating the structural material zones with lower stress with an effective method for achieving the structural efficiency of a tall building, considering architectural aspects.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:37","2024-03-12 16:48:11","","","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\AR3HPHBJ\Baghbanan et al. - 2023 - Architectural Form Finding and Computational Desig.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JAEIED.AEENG-1380","Architectural design; Form-finding; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations; Computational design; Finite element method; Grasshopper; Structural optimization; Tall building; Topology; Topology optimization; Optimization method; Bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method; Engineering science; Finite-element method; Karamba; Lateral loads; Topology optimisation; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 1_Topology; 7_Part of Building (Lateral system); 3_Stiffness (Compliance)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of platforms complicates the thermal and energy performance of atriums by affecting the indoor temperature gradients, air flow and thermal comforts. The resulted effects by complex atrium metrics, the interaction between them and the corresponding optimization pathways become the major cognition which are urgently needed. However, relevant studies have seldom addressed impacts of complex atrium geometries on the thermal and energy consumption of hotels. In this study, the sensitivity of key complex atrium design parameters (i.e., space height, the position of platform, atrium shape) and envelope parameters (the skylight area ratio and window-to-wall ratio) towards the energy utilization indexes (EUI) of hotel buildings were quantitatively and comparatively analyzed via orthogonal experiments and energy simulations. The floor height of 3.9 m, the rectangular or trapezoidal atrium profile shape, and atrium shape * skylight area ratio (interaction) should be the critical energy conservation factors. By means of field measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, regulating effect and gallery ventilation of the platform on indoor thermal environment and the optimal position of platform (at the top of the second floor) has been validated. The relationship model between the two slope-related parameters (i.e., complex atrium height H and the upper side length of a trapezoidal atrium Wa) of the trapezoidal atrium profiles and the energy consumption is proposed by multi-factor fitting based on the typical building model with the optimal position of the platform. The quantitative correlations between the atrium's STH and energy performance are presented. With the same atrium H, the smaller the STH, the less energy consumption of the building. With the same atrium Wa, the higher H, the less energy consumption of the building. The research findings can provide the theoretical basis and design guidance for energy-saving oriented early phase atrium designs in hotels among similar climates. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:37","2024-02-20 10:35:04","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106698","Architectural design; Floors; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Air conditioning; Building energy performance; Design parameters; Computational fluid dynamics; Simulation platform; Hotels; Energy-consumption; Area ratios; Atria platform position; Atrium designs; Atrium platform position; Complex spatial atria; Complex spatial atrium; Optimal position; Slope of trapezoidal atria profile; Slope of trapezoidal atrium profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this, it is essential to ensure coexistence between different analysis programs such as three-dimensional (3D), energy, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models that can be applied on a single platform such as building information modeling (BIM). This research aims, first, to define and document a holistic design approach to building performance optimization concerning energy usage by employing the BIM platform and, second, to underline interoperability and data exchange between current technology and commercially available software from different vendors. Therefore, the novelty of this study is to serve a systematic, multiobjective, and multicriterion optimization of building performance with a holistic approach in the BIM platform. The holistic design approach is for a multidisciplinary design process including three stages (conceptual, schematic, and detailed) that cover different optimization criteria (building envelope design, occupants' comfort conditions, and building' energy consumption). The proposed method aims to generate, evaluate, develop, and utilize a 3D model during the different design stages concerning the model's level of details and included information, which underlines the usage of 3D model-related software and sharing data among the design stages. A BIM-based method is developed through the case study of a hypothetical, two-story building (domestic dwelling) by identifying the activities of each design stage. With the implementation of the proposed method, the result shows a predicted energy saving of up to 75%, with a detailed energy analysis placing the building energy performance in the ""A""class (annual energy consumption 17,865 kW · h).

Therefore, it is essential to integrate building performance simulation modeling from an early design stage. A critical part of the simulated environment is the weather file. It is a compilation of 20-30 years of historical weather and hourly data on temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction. The accuracy and contextual relevance of said data are of utmost importance to the integrity of the analysis. Current energy modeling weather files are unlikely to include any indication of risk from potential climate change. Hence, there is a need to incorporate climate change projections in energy simulations and prepare architects to understand better the evolution of design strategies echoing such climate change in different climate zones.

To start with the full pipeline, 2D feature images of ortho-image and elevation-map are converted from the reality data. A deep learning-based light convolutional encoder-decoder was developed, and compared with U-Net (a binary segmentation model), for image pixelwise segmentation to realize automatic site surface classification, object detection, and ground control point identification. Then, the proposed elevation clustering and segmentation algorithms can automatically extract contours for each instance from each surface or object category. Experimental results showed that the developed light model achieved comparable results with U-Net in landing pad segmentation with average intersection over union (IoU) of 0.900 versus 0.969. With the proposed data augmentation strategy, the light model had a testing pixel accuracy of 0.9764 and mean IoU of 0.8922 in the six-class segmentation testing task. Additionally, for surfaces with continuous elevation changes (i.e., ground), the developed algorithm created contours only have an average elevation difference of 1.68 cm compared to dense point clouds using drones and image-based reality data. For objects with discrete elevation changes (i.e., stair treads), the generated contours accurately represent objects' elevations with zero difference using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The contribution of this research is to develop algorithms that automatically transfer the scanned LA scenes to contours with real-world coordinates to create as-built computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, which can further assist building information modeling (BIM) model creation and inspect the scanned LA scenes with augmented reality. The optimized parameters for the developed algorithms are analyzed and recommended for future applications. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:38","2024-02-20 10:41:26","","","","5","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-13077","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Structural design; Computer aided design; Building Information Modelling; Deep learning; Computer-aided design; Building information modeling (BIM); LiDAR; Optical radar; Clustering algorithms; Object detection; Light detection and ranging; 3d reality data; 3D reality data; As-build; As-built; Augmented reality; Augmented reality (AR); Clustering; Clusterings; Computer-aided design  drawing; Computer-aided design (CAD) drawing; Deep learning (DL); Design drawings; Drones; Image segmentation; Object extraction; Object recognition; Segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the previous studies conducted separate research on the two stages. Besides, most studies did not fully consider the interests of different stakeholders when improving the building energy flexibility. To address the above problems, the numerical model of the PCM-integrated building is built and verified. A demand-side management which includes pre-cooling and floating indoor air set point is applied to the building under the dynamic pricing in Hong Kong. A multi-objective optimization model is built considering the interests of the power grid, building users, and the environment. Three optimal schemes are obtained, which include the optimal parameters of the PCM and the pre-cooling time length. The results show that, compared with the reference case, the energy flexibility indexes of the three optimal schemes are 24.21%, 26.75%, and 32.78%. The peak load of the three optimal schemes is reduced by 90.78%, 92.67%, and 92.87%, while the total energy usage, electricity bills, and CO2 emissions are also reduced. Using the optimal parameters design and control strategy on the PCM-integrated building benefits the grid, building users, and the environment simultaneously.

The proposed method is based on the application of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) to Building Energy Modeling (BEM) technique. Specifically, by a BIM model of the ship a 3D physics-based model (BEM) can be suitably created. Then, by BEM the ship energy performance is simulated under real and dynamic operating conditions. By the presented method the whole design-to-delivery process of the ship can be simplified and speeded up with respect to traditional approaches, without losing reliability. As an example, HVAC systems design is easier through BIM since a high number of thermal zones can be effectively handled. Due to BEM, also the optimal design for exploiting waste heat recoveries of on-board combustion engines is easier and faster. To show the capability of the proposed approach a suitable case study was developed. Basically, it concerns the energy performance analysis of the Allure of the Seas, a 6000-passenger cruise ship operating in the Caribbean Sea. Two different scenarios for recovering the waste heat of the ship diesel generators are investigated. Simulation results highlight that significant primary energy saving can be obtained by optimizing the strategy to recover the available thermal energies (up to 600 MWh per trip), with a remarkable amount of avoided pollutant emissions (58, 0.06, 4.0, 0.2, 2.0 kg/km of CO2, PM2.5, NOx, HC, SOx, respectively).The presented new approach can be easily adopted to design and optimize the energy system of any new or existing ships, with the twofold aim to achieve economic savings and to fulfil environmental sustainability standards. © 2023 The Authors","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:38","2024-02-20 10:29:34","","","","","235","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121359","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; Construction industry; Sustainable development; Boundary element method; Building energy model; Climate control; Energy optimization; 3D modeling; Dynamics simulation; Energy design; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; BIM2BEM; Building Energy Modelling; Building Information Modeling; Dynamic Simulation; Maritime sector; Recovery; Ship energy efficiency; Ship Energy efficiency; Ships; Sustainability in maritime sector; Waste incineration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, this study aims at addressing the existing gap in designing elevated coastal buildings, which stems from lack of a generalizable equation for estimating vertical hurricane wave and surge forces for a variety of building geometries and wave conditions. To this end, based on a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, six key variables that affect the wave forces on buildings are considered, which include building dimensions (length and width of rectangular plan buildings) and wave characteristics. In addition, the effect of building length in relation to wave length on the resulting vertical forces is explicitly considered, while the effect of building width is considered implicitly. Subsequently, a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) strategy is implemented for generating 256 random samples, each representing a unique building geometry with a rectangular plan and wave condition scenario. A pipeline is then developed for generating CFD models corresponding to each sample, which are then deployed on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, creating a dataset of vertical surge and wave forces. Based on the key design variables, an ensemble of Machine Learning (ML) models is developed to predict vertical wave forces. For the purpose of design and risk assessment, different force levels may be of interest. Therefore, different models were trained to predict multiple levels of forces on elevated buildings, including maximum, average, 25th, 75th, and 99th percentiles of peak forces. The developed model for each of these force levels is then investigated to identify the main building geometry and wave conditions features that affect the resulting forces, which can inform the decisions of the designers in the early-stage phases. For further assistance in the early-stage design, based on a subset of identified important features, a simple expression for each force level is provided to narrow down the design space to top performing early design candidates, while the main estimators can be used for the final design of elevated buildings. Results show that based on CFD simulations, highly accurate and generalizable predictive models with error rates of about 4% on the test set can be developed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:38","2024-02-20 10:36:15","","","","","183","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2023.104325","Architectural design; multistorey building; Structural design; machine learning; Geometry; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Risk assessment; High performance computing; loading; computer simulation; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Building geometry; Hurricanes; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; CFD modeling; Coastal resiliency; fluid-structure interaction; Fluid-structure interaction; High Performance Computing; hurricane; Machine Learning; ocean wave; Performance computing; storm surge; Wave conditions; Wave force","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coming up with an eco-friendly and energy-efficient building design requires a comprehensive yet complicated optimization that involves a large domain of design measures and indicators due to operational-embodied energy and carbon emissions-energy trade-offs. This paper proposes a multi-phase and multi-objective genetic based framework that couples EnergyPlus to the embodied energy and embodied carbon databases to jointly assess and optimize both the operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions. It determines the most optimal building configuration by adjusting design measures, which encompass geometrical parameters like window-to-wall ratio and building orientation and envelope-related variables such as the construction materials in external walls and window glazing type. This framework is applied to an ASHRAE benchmark model of a small office building located in College Station, Texas, which falls in climate zone 2A. ASHRAE standards 90.1 is considered for creating the initial baseline design. The building is optimized in two phases. In the first phase, the building is optimized for operational and embodied energy to understand potential tradeoffs. In the second phase, the building is optimized to reduce operational and embodied energy as well as carbon emissions simultaneously. This two-phase optimization culminated into two different Pareto front solutions. The results of the first stage of the optimization lead to a 9.73% and a 37.29% reduction in the building's total operational and embodied energy, respectively from the initial baseline design. In the second phase, the building's operational Energy, embodied energy, operational carbon emissions and embodied carbon emissions are reduced by 9.51%, 37.44%, 17.43%, and 35.67%, respectively in comparison with the baseline model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:38","2024-02-20 10:39:08","","","","","428","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139510","Architectural design; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Optimisations; Structural design; Building materials; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Geometry; Multiobjective optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Carbon footprint; Embodied energy; Operational energy; Air conditioning; Building envelopes; Climate models; NSGA-II; Carbon emissions; Energy emissions; Muti-objective optimization; Operational carbon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There have been limited attempts, and previous studies which targeted the optimisation of structural elements did not address the association of individual elements with the envelope shape of the overall building. This study presents a new Parametric BIM-based Optimality Criteria (PBIM-OC) method that enables multi-objective optimisation of envelope shape and element size for tall buildings. The study proposes a comprehensive parameterisation method to describe the complex geometrics of envelope shapes for high-rise buildings. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) were used to conduct multi-objective optimisation, providing optimal solutions for envelope shapes that maximise structural cost and operating energy efficiencies. The illustrative examples show a structurally inefficient building shape design can lead to a 60% of structural cost difference. This study contributes a new parametric optimisation method that explores optimal designs and investigates the influence of geometric changes in building envelopes on performance solutions. The results provide insights into the relationship between building envelopes and structural efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between structural material cost and energy performance of high-rise buildings.

The building design phase has the most significant potential to reduce building life-cycle carbon emissions (LCCO2). However, the lack of detailed inventory data at the design stage makes calculating a building’s LCCO2 very difficult and complex. Therefore, accurate prediction of building LCCO2 at the design stage using relevant design factors is essential to reduce carbon emissions. This paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm combining Bayesian optimization and extreme gradient boosting (BO-XGBoost) to predict LCCO2 accurately in residential buildings. First, this study collected and calculated the LCCO2 of 121 residential buildings in Chengdu, China. Second, a carbon emission prediction model was developed using XGBoost based on 15 design factors, and hyperparameter optimization was performed using the BO algorithm. Finally, the model performance was evaluated using two evaluation metrics, coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean square error (RMSE), and the prediction performance of other models was compared with that of the BO-XGBoost model. The results show that the RMSE of the proposed BO-XGBoost for predicting LCCO2 in residential buildings is at least 40% lower compared to other models. The method adopted in this study can help designers accurately predict building LCCO2 at the early design stage and provide methodological support for similar studies in the future. © 2023, Tsinghua University Press.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:38","2024-02-20 10:31:43","","1451-1466","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-023-1024-2","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Life cycle; Forecasting; Residential building; Housing; Mean square error; life cycle; Design stage; Predictive models; Carbon emissions; Bayesian optimization; Building carbon emission; building carbon emissions; Chengdu; Emissions prediction; Gradient boosting; predictive model; Xgboost; XGBoost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates the impact of common shading devices such as overhangs, fins, horizontal blinds, vertical blinds and drapes on energy consumption of an office building and suggests energy efficient shading device strategies in the contexts of unique Bangladeshi subtropical monsoon climate. Design/methodology/approach: This research was performed through the energy simulation perspective of a prototype office building using a validated building energy simulation tool eQUEST. Around 100 simulation patterns were created considering various types of shading devices and building orientations. The simulation results were analysed comprehensively to find out energy-efficient shading device strategies. Findings: Optimum overhang and fin height is equal to half of the window height in the context of the subtropical climate of Bangladesh. South and West are the most vulnerable orientations, and application of shading devices on these two orientations shows the highest reduction of cooling load and the lowest increment of lighting load. An existing building was able to save approximately 7.05% annual energy consumption by applying the shading device strategies that were suggested by this study. Originality/value: The shading device strategies of this study can be incorporated into the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) as new energy-efficient building design strategies because the BNBC does not have any codes or regulations regarding energy-efficient shading device.

Thus, this paper presents a controlled framework for selecting the adequate structural floor system for reinforced concrete buildings and efficiently utilizing the corresponding construction materials. Optimization was performed using an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the total construction cost, considering the costs of concrete, steel reinforcement, formwork, and labor. In the problem formulation, the characteristic compressive strength of concrete was treated as a design variable because it affects the mechanical performance of concrete. The design variables included the column spacings, concrete dimensions, and steel reinforcement of different structural components. The constraints reflected the Egyptian code of practice provisions. Because the choice of the structural floor system affects the design details, three systems were considered: Solid slabs, flat slabs with drop panels, and flat slabs without drop panels. Two benchmark examples were presented, and the optimal design results of the structural floor systems were compared. The solid slab system had the lowest construction cost among the three structural floor systems. Comparative diagrams were developed to investigate the distribution of construction costs of each floor system. The results revealed that an adequate choice of design variables could save up to 17% of the building’s total construction cost. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the high computational cost of the structural analysis step hinders its application in practical cases. With regards to this problem, a novel hybrid optimization framework is developed in this study. Discrete variables, code-stipulated constraints and other construction requirements under multiple loading scenarios are considered. The hybrid optimization framework contains two steps: in the first step, a computationally efficient approximation of the optimization formulation is constructed using a combined response surface methodology (RSM). Combining all the design constraints, three sub-optimization problems are proposed based on the relaxation model of the original problem to update the response surface model in the near-optimum region. When the response surface model has sufficient accuracy in the near-optimum region, in the second step, a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is applied to search for the optimal solution utilizing the response surface model. By integrating the commercially available ETABS, a dedicated optimization software with an independent interface is developed and details for practical software development are included in this paper. Three examples of high-rise concrete building design are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework, and the results are compared to those of a general PSO algorithm. It is shown that, compared to the conventional design approach, a 14.3% reduction in material usage is achieved by the hybrid optimization framework. Additionally, the proposed framework significantly improves the computational efficiency compared to PSO. This methodology can therefore be used by engineers to optimize member sizes for high-rise buildings so that stable and sustainable designs can be achieved. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:39","2024-03-25 12:55:05","","","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 5</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\EJIIUDDY\Lou et al. - 2022 - Size optimization design of members for shear wall.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105292","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Structural design; Tall buildings; Computational efficiency; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Structural optimization; Optimization framework; Surface properties; Software design; Particle size analysis; Response surface; Computer software; High rise; Discrete sizing optimization; High-rise concrete building; High-rise concrete buildings; Multiple loading; Multiple loading scenario; Multiple loading scenarios; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Part of building (Shear walls)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A constraint is conceived as a direct control on design formation, or as a filter which does not impose a control over a formation process. The paper aims to gain insights into the ways the designers manipulate constraints in the digital design process. It investigated whether the same type of buildings, designed by the same or different architects, presents different approaches to deal with the same constraint. Scenarios of handling a constraint using shaping and validation processes were identified before initial modelling, through modelling, and after modelling. Constraints can effectively participate in design formation by proposing a new shape or a typical shape at pre-modelling. They are refining or developing the initial design through modelling, and optimizing or enhancing the design after modelling. Furthermore, constraints play significant roles in the feasibility study of design solutions. This is done by evaluating the initial forms and selecting the fittest through modelling, in addition to testing and filtering the solution space after modelling, and approving the final design. The paper examined the impact of wind on the morphology of twelve contemporary tower designs. The findings support the opinion that constraints may not restrict the designer's free will, inspiration, and creativity. They revealed that different scenarios of wind-driven processes had implemented at different design stages even by the same designer. The wind constraint had a substantial impact on the derivation of new morphologies. Through modelling, it had an active role in the refinement of the initial architectural and structural design. Constraint-based design was handled in iterative processes of evaluating and developing or refining the initial forms through modelling; and optimizing or enhancing, testing, and approving the final forms after modelling. © 2022 WITPress.

The study is an initial design method utilising a robust computational calculation aiming to verify expanded metal as an environmentally friendly building material concerning its function as a shading device. The proposed platform generatively iterates the logic of expanded metal as dynamic design variables, such as Bond, Strand, Length, Height and Angle, to achieve the optimisation goals of minimising Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) while simultaneously maximising Spatial Daylight Autonomy, Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and the openness of the expanded-metal profile. Ladybug and Honeybee were utilised in a parametric platform, Grasshopper, to perform daylight simulation, while Octopus was employed to optimise the results. A thorough analysis was conducted to determine the significance of each expanded-metal parameter in achieving the daylight and View objectives. The results showed that adopting the proposed framework successfully fulfilled the LEED v4.1 daylight requirements by reducing ASE by 100% and improving UDI by approximately 50% over the baseline model.

Low-carbon designs have been explored by conducting both member-level and structure-level analyses for concrete structures. However, methods for combining two-tiered research need to be further developed to reduce the cost of design optimization. This study aims to propose a hybrid iterative approach for the low-carbon optimization of concrete framed structures. Accordingly, the integrated structural analysis was applied to design the initial scheme, subproject-based emission assessment was applied to identify the carbon-intensive structural components, and a genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the desired components subjected to relevant design constraints. A case study was made on a residential building to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. The optimization results indicated that a potential 18.3% and 4.2% reduction in the embodied emissions from the beams and the building main body were achieved, respectively. A further discussion also proposed that an optimized scheme for interior walls using lightweight panels resulted in a 12% reduction in carbon emissions compared to the initial scheme using masonry walls. The proposed method and results can facilitate understanding the low-carbon design optimization of reinforced concrete structures and, therefore, contribute to carbon reduction of the construction industry. © 2023 The Author(s).

The skins are formed by panels with attached SMA wires and can be periodically arranged to form a building envelope. When the environmental temperature is below the SMA austenitic transformation temperatures, the SMA wires are relaxed and the panel forms a closed surface, preventing circulation of exterior airflow into the building. When the environmental temperature exceeds such SMA transformation temperatures, the SMA wires contract and bend the panel to create an opening that enables circulation of airflow into the building. The response of the adaptive skins is evaluated through a thermomechanically coupled finite element model. The applied thermal loads are determined from published field measurements. Metallic materials and fiber-reinforced composites are explored as candidates for the panel. Genetic algorithms are employed for optimization, where the objective is that the panel exhibits a large opening when the environmental temperature exceeds a prescribed ideal temperature and stays closed otherwise. Optimization results show that two-layered composite panels with ply angles of 45°/−45° and thicknesses of 0.1/0.25 mm (layers ordered from the interior to the exterior side) display the most favorable performance. © The Author(s) 2022.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:40","2024-02-20 10:38:50","","2086-2105","","16","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 5</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1045389X211072202","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Fiber reinforced plastics; Design optimization; Shape-memory alloy; Model optimization; actuator; Building skins; Design studies; Environmental temperature; Modelling studies; shape memory; Shape memory alloy wire; Shape-memory; Transformation temperatures; Wire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On top of the structural role of energy piles to transfer the mechanical loads of buildings to the ground, they are used to dissipate heat energy into the soil to reduce the consumption of energy and hence lower greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, eight factors affecting the thermal conductance of the energy piles are investigated to maximize the thermal performance of energy piles. These eight factors are the number of U-tubes, pile diameter, tube diameter, tube thickness, pile thermal conductivity, tube thermal conductivity, soil thermal conductivity, and velocity of circulated water in U-tubes. The significance of these factors is statistically evaluated, and the optimal values of the significant factors are obtained using response surface methodology. The results reveal that tube thickness, water velocity, and soil conductivity have an insignificant impact on thermal conductance of the energy piles, while other factors have a significant effect.

We developed a toolchain that comprehensively covers the stages, from determining user-related electricity demand to thermal demand calculation and energy conversion system design, up to deterministic design optimization of storage systems. By means of design of experiments, we systematically applied the toolchain to an all-electric non-residential building as a use case. We find that weather has the strongest correlation with optimal storage sizes and the size of energy conversion systems. They are also affected by the usage intensity of certain building zones. In addition, the storage sizes influence each other in the complex building energy system of our use case.

The mathematical problem is formulated as a minimum material volume problem subject to compliance and design check constraints imposed by the serviceability and ultimate limit states of the Eurocode design provisions, while the optimized designs achieved are composed of standardized section properties of the Euronorm. Most of the studies that rely on ground structure topology optimization formulation are limited to truss structures, while compliance is used as the objective to be minimized.

The minimum material volume problem initially is dealt with by a frame structural topology optimization (FSTO) approach representing the conceptual design phase followed by a sizing structural design optimization procedure referring to the final design phase. In order to test the efficiency of the methodology, it is implemented for designing the structural system of MRBFs for mid- and high-rise building structures.

As the share of ventilation heating needs grow in well-insulated and airtight buildings, heat recovery in mechanical ventilation systems is increasingly common. Ventilation heat recovery is one of the most efficient and viable means to reduce ventilation heat losses and save energy. Highly efficient heat exchangers are being developed or applied to maximise the energy-saving potential of heat recovery ventilation. Nevertheless, the effects of practical operating conditions and the constraints of heat recovery – such as variations in ventilation rates, frost protection, and the prevention of an overheated air supply over a long-term period, which may significantly influence realistic recovery rates – have been less considered in efforts to maximise the energy savings. It is unclear which design parameters for heat recovery devices have the greatest effect on the annual energy savings from ventilation. This study proposes annual efficiency and annual net energy saving models for heat recovery ventilation that consider ventilation rate variations, the longitudinal heat conduction effect and operating controls. We use a global sensitivity analysis to quantify the contributions of various design input parameters to the variation in annual recovery efficiency and annual net energy savings. We identify the most influential parameters and their significant interaction effects for the annual energy performance of heat recovery ventilation. More attention should be paid to these most influential parameters during the design process. Furthermore, the optimal designs for rotary heat exchangers (as identified by a pattern-search optimisation algorithm) can improve annual net energy savings in demand-controlled ventilation by 33–48%, depending on the building areas. In combination with the reference year analysis presented in this study, heat recovery and demand-controlled ventilation can help to meet the need for highly efficient ventilation systems and zero-emission buildings. © 2022 The Author(s)","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:40","2024-02-20 10:36:43","","","","","329","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120237","Architectural design; architectural design; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Sensitivity analysis; heating; Ventilation; ventilation; sensitivity analysis; Zero emission buildings; heat transfer; Heat exchangers; Energy efficient; Energy  savings; Energy-savings; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Energy-efficient ventilation; Global sensitivity analysis; Heat conduction; Net energy; Rotary heat exchanger; Rotary heat exchangers; Ventilation rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tese structures are prone to excessive wind-induced lateral vibrations in the crosswind direction owing to vortex shedding efects, causing occupant discomfort and, ultimately, dynamic serviceability failure. To reconcile the worldwide accelerated trend in constructing tall buildings with the sustainable building sector agenda, this paper proposes a novel bi-objective integrated design framework that leverages dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) to minimize the required material usage in the wind load-resisting structural systems (WLSSs) of occupant comfort-governed tall buildings. Te framework couples structural sizing optimization for minimum-weight WLSS design (objective 1), with optimal DVA tuning for foor acceleration minimization to satisfy codifed wind comfort design requirements by using the smallest DVA inertia (objective 2). Furthermore, a versatile numerical strategy is devised for the efcient solution of the proposed bi-objective optimization problem. For illustration, the framework is applied to a 15-storey steel building equipped with one of two diferent DVAs: a widely considered top-foor tuned mass damper (TMD) and an innovative ground-foor tuned inerter damper (TID). Te derived Pareto optimal integrated (WLSS-plus-DVA) designs demonstrate that signifcant reduction in both structural steel usage and embodied carbon emissions can be achieved using either one of the two DVAs with moderate inertia. It is concluded that the proposed optimization-driven design framework and numerical solution strategy ofer an alternative innovative approach to achieve material-efcient high-rise buildings under wind hazards.

In this paper, a multi-objective coordinated design optimization method of school buildings is proposed to realize the efficient global design optimization of school building envelopes and energy systems. The method is mainly divided into three modules: coordinated design variables, envelope optimization and energy system optimization. In the process of coordinated design optimization, through the iterative method based on multi-objective optimization of envelope, multi-attribute decision-making for Pareto scheme set and single-objective optimization of energy system, the error between the optimal values of the coordinated design variable of the envelop and the energy system is reduced, and finally the global optimal design scheme is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization method is verified by a case study. The results show that the proposed coordinated design optimization method is stable and reliable.

Building for Environment and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software is used to calculate the life cycle environmental impact inventory and embodied environmental impact. Furthermore, C# programming language is used to select 25 green building envelope packages with minimal environmental impact.

Specifically, objective of the study is to implement building integrated photovoltaic thermal devices coupled with a phase change materials heat exchanger acting as an active thermal storage building component, with the aim to add flexibility to the building while still maintaining indoor comfort conditions. To show the potentials of the novel configuration proposed in this paper, a multi-zone grey-box model is developed and validated to capture the thermal dynamics of a building, and a control strategy applied to the whole system is developed for energy management purpose. The whole simulation model, including thermophysical properties of the building-system and the control features, is implemented in a MATLAB environment. To assess the model and application potentials toward the optimal design and operation of the proposed system for energy efficiency and flexibility goals, a suitable case study analysis is conducted. Thus, a sensitivity analysis, using an evolutionary algorithm, is performed by considering economic and energy objective functions which focuses on the reduction of the building energy demand, load variability and economic aspects. In this regard, the optimal design configuration is underlined in a way that the operation of the components can be maximized to provide flexibility to the building: in average working conditions one single layer of PCM can provide around 186.3 Wh/K per unit of temperature and width. A rule-based management strategy is proposed to prove the possibility to shift and shave the energy peaks during high energy request periods, demand response events.

Therefore, understanding the impact of building design on construction cost and the carbon footprint associated with offsite construction is important for the improved sustainability and climate resilience of the built environment. This study aims to develop a system approach, with the aid of building information modeling (BIM), for 3D geometric modeling and automatic generative design toward optimizing the carbon footprint and construction cost from offsite construction. A mathematical formulation is proposed to represent the topological relationships between different kinds of precast and cast-in-situ elements, which in turn, underpin 3D geometric modeling for possible geometric variations within precast buildings. New generative algorithms are developed to automatically manipulate building geometrics subject to pre-defined constraints, and create parametric BIM models in compliance with material types assigned by users. A BIM-based automation tool is developed to extract and match the model geometry/material information with a customized BIM object library, through which carbon emission factors and cost coefficients can be retrieved for multi-criteria sustainability analysis. The proposed new approach empowers 3D geometric modeling and geometry-based design automation, which enable comprehensive exploration of design alternates in precast construction. The proposed new method is illustrated via a case study that investigates the impact of different design variations on embodied carbon and construction cost of precast structures. The proposed BIM development takes around 30 minutes to create 1,000-1,500 new design options. Besides, it produces design options that contain a 30% less carbon footprint and construction cost than reference buildings from the literature. The results indicate that our proposed method can support automated design exploration at early stages, which help to identify optimal solutions for more informed decision making. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:41","2024-02-20 10:31:48","","","","10","148","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 19</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\QEWDUULK\Gan - 2022 - BIM-Based Building Geometric Modeling and Automati.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002369","Architectural design; Automation; Building information modeling; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Computer aided design; Construction; Construction costs; Decision making; Building Information Modelling; Geometry; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Carbon footprint; Generative design; Off-site construction; Design automations; Design automation; Building information modeling (BIM); 3D modeling; Design option; Model-based OPC; 3D geometric model; 3D geometric modeling; Offsite construction; Pre-cast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They also considered one of the major energy consumers with little regards to sustainability. Tall building is wind-sensitive structure and shape plays major role in determining wind loads, which usually govern the design of its lateral resisting system. Thus, evaluating wind loads properly and designing an optimal lateral system accordingly are the main challenges attributed to the design process of irregular tall building. This paper presents a computational procedure for the optimal design of wind-resistant irregular tall building to minimize the total weight of structure within design requirements in single digital environment. That is achieved firstly by creating a digital system of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis that is coupled with pressure-load translation (PLT) algorithm to evaluate the wind motions on irregular tall buildings and generate the design wind loads accordingly. Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enhance design constrains function of lateral displacements, inter-story drifts and top acceleration is then developed to perform structural optimization. A numerical example using 70-story twisting reinforced concrete building is implemented to verify the feasibility of the developed computational procedures. Steady and incompressible flow applied at ((Formula presented.)) angle of attack was implemented in the CFD model to simulate the wind flow on the studied building. Genetic algorithm with improved design constraints of static and dynamic design requirements was developed to optimize the structure effectively and efficiently. The numerical example demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving 35.71% reduction of concrete volume from the original lateral structural system design. This is also translated into a sustainability value by lessening the embedded carbon dioxide by 4,400 tons.

To this end, cost design optimization was performed for buildings with three different floor systems: flat plates (FS), flat slabs with drop panels (FSDP), and solid slabs (SS). The evolutionary method provided by the Excel solver was used as the optimization algorithm because it can deal with the complex nature of structural design problems. The objective function was the total construction cost of the building, including the costs of concrete, reinforcement bars, labor, and formwork, while still fulfilling the constraints of the Egyptian code of practice (ECP-18). The applicability of the presented algorithm was investigated in a design example, where the tuning of the evolutionary algorithm control parameters was sought, and the best parameters were investigated. Two case studies were employed to study the impacts of changing the column spacing and concrete grades on the optimal cost for each floor system. The results showed that low concrete grades, (i.e., characteristic strength up to 40 MPa) and column spacings up to 5 m are preferred in terms of direct construction costs for low-rise RC residential buildings. © 2022 by the authors.

Some studies have successfully developed theoretical models for calculating the effect of airflow fields on infection rates. However, up until now, studies have primarily focused on simulating and calculating the distribution of viral infection rates in current building scenarios. Due to the lack of a direct influence model for the design parameters and infection rate calculation, the present studies lack a quantitative analysis of the design parameters. This paper investigates the building openings design approach in a medium-sized kindergarten in Germany, intending to explore passive-based design solutions to improve the building’s ability to prevent the virus’ spread. We calculate the infection rate distribution in space by CFD combined with the Wells-Riley model. And then, use the Grasshopper platform to build an optimization model with the design parameters of building openings and infection rate values to discuss the relationship between geometric parameters and infection rate variation. The results show that the building openings’ design parameters in transition spaces significantly affect the indoor infection rate under the condition that the input wind speed at the building openings is stable. We can see that optimizing building openings significantly reduces the average infection rate in space. The infection rate in the area with the largest decrease can be reduced by 18.41%. The distribution of infection rate in space is much more uniform, and the excess area is significantly reduced.

In Australia, BIPV roofing is considered to be promising because of recent major concerns about fire risks of façades. However, the integration of PV into building envelope elements is a complicated process which, if not done properly, may lead to failure of the BIPV system. Therefore, feasible BIPV design solutions need to be examined in terms of life-cycle cost and energy performance from the early design phase of a BIPV envelope project. There have been few investigations of the identification of feasible BIPV design options in the early design phase to enable product selection and parametric tests. This study explores a multi-objective optimization method which formulates feasible BIPV envelope design options which have relatively high energy generation and low life cycle costs to informed decision making. The optimisation process has four segments: data inputs, simulator, optimizer and pareto front based optimised BIPV solutions. The proposed multi- objective optimization process is applied in a BIPV roof application using a case study in Australia with roof sheets and skylights. The results demonstrate seven optimum roof sheet BIPV design solutions and fourteen optimum skylight BIPV design solutions to enable design makers to compare and select the most appropriate. The life cycle cost, life cycle energy, CO2 emissions avoided, net present value, payback period, and levelized cost of energy of BIPV solutions vary based on the BIPV modules, tilt angles and placement locations. The proposed optimization method is a helpful guide for BIPV design professionals to identify suitable BIPV design options in the early design phase instead of relying on rule-of-thumb experience. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:41","2024-02-20 10:05:41","","","","","309","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 24</p>","","","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; design; Life cycle; Costs; Decision making; Ecodesign; Multiobjective optimization; parameterization; Investments; Life cycle energies; Solar buildings; Roofs; Building envelopes; Life cycle cost; Multi-objectives optimization; Product design; Design solutions; photovoltaic system; Building integrated photovoltaic; feasibility study; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Early design phase; Life cycle energy; Australia; Building-integrated photovoltaic designs; Design option; Early design phasis; Multi-objective design optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While embodied emissions mainly occur in the construction phase, the operational emissions occur during the entire building life and are influenced by future developments such as climate change, electricity grid decarbonization, and user behavior. Suitable methods which allow considering these uncertainties already during the design stage are robustness assessments. This study proposes a scenario-based robustness assessment method to investigate the effects of future developments on buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate the scenario generation, building energy simulation, calculation of embodied and operational emissions, and the statistical evaluation of the results according to different robustness metrics. Two simulation models with different time scales are compared with a total of 12 test cases. Finally, the robustness assessment is demonstrated on a case study, where a total of 40 configurations against 1260 scenarios are investigated using five different robustness metrics: minimax regret, Spread, Maximin, Laplace's Principle of insufficient reasoning, and Starr's Domain criterion. For the case study, a multi-family house located in Zurich, Switzerland, we demonstrate how future developments, e.g., climate change and electricity grid decarbonization, influence the building's greenhouse gas emission performance. For example, with slow decarbonization, heat pump systems perform most robustly compared to the other analyzed heating and cooling systems. Depending on the chosen robustness metrics, it is further possible to rate the solutions according to optimistic, pessimistic, or optimal preference, making the proposed framework a valuable tool for decision-makers. In a time of transition, we conclude that analyzing building performance without future-oriented data is not suitable, and we encourage building designers to assess the impact of possible future scenarios in the design phase instead of purely using norm-based standard values, entirely based on data from the past. © 2022 The Author(s)","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:42","2024-02-20 10:05:42","","","","","311","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","Architectural design; architectural design; building construction; Structural design; Life cycle; Construction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; life cycle analysis; Building energy simulations; climate change; Heating; Electric power transmission networks; assessment method; Behavioral research; Zero energy buildings; simulation; Climate change; Cooling systems; Robustness assessment; Building energy simulation; building code; Building systems; greenhouse gas; Greenhouse gas emissions; Building greenhouse gas emission; Building greenhouse gas emissions; Building system robustness; Decarbonisation; Decarbonization; electricity; Scenario-based; Scenario-based robustness assessment; Switzerland; System robustness; Zurich [Switzerland]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optical properties of pigmented glazing depends on pigment radius, volume fraction and glazing thickness. In this study, two main design variables that are pigment radius and volume fraction are examined by applying parametric analysis for a constant glazing thickness that is identical to a standard ordinary glass. The radiative transfer through glazings are solved using four flux method to predict the optical properties of the glazings. The optimum thermo-chromic glazings are identified and energy efficiency along with resulting daylight illuminance are compared with that of an ordinary double glazing for several geographical locations.

More particularly, the algorithm is applied to the minimum material cost design of a 4-storey and a 12-storey 3D RC building according to Eurocodes. It is found that the SBO algorithm can converge earlier than other well-established metaheuristic optimization algorithms reducing considerably the required computational effort.

Design/methodology/approach: This framework relies on a computationally efficient approximation of the constraint and objective functions using a radial basis function model with a linear tail, also called the combined response surface methodology (RSM) in this article. Considering both the code-stipulated constraints and other construction requirements, three sub-optimization problems were constructed based on the relaxation model of the original problem, and then the structural weight could be automatically minimized under multiple constraints and loading scenarios. After modulization, the obtained results could meet the discretization requirements. By integrating the commercially available ETABS, a dedicated optimization software program with an independent interface was developed and details for practical software development were also presented in this paper. Findings: The proposed framework was used to optimize different high-rise concrete buildings, and case studies showed that material usage could be saved by up to 12.8% compared to the conventional design, and the over-limit constraints could be adjusted, which proved the feasibility and effectiveness.

Efficient structural components could result in building weight reductions, leading to material savings and a reduced carbon footprint. Shaping of concrete slabs through structural optimization has recently seen significant interest due to advancements in digital fabrication and the potential for more sustainable and architecturally expressive designs. However, many promising optimization-based approaches to shaping slabs do not consider secondary design aspects during computational exploration, including acoustics. This paper presents a computational investigation of trade-offs between structural and acoustic objectives using a multiobjective optimization framework while designing concrete slabs with curved ribs. A series of Pareto front approximations and constrained optimization runs at specific acoustic performance levels were used to explore optimal designs, while evaluating how a computational search for competing objectives distributes structural material. Shaped slabs were then compared to conventional floor assemblies.

As a relatively new structural solution, there is a need to study modular buildings' optimal design. In this regard, previous studies focused only on employing optimisation techniques at the member level to enhance the structural capacity of steel beams in modular building systems (MBS). This paper explores the applicability and effectiveness of an optimality criteria (OC)-based minimum-weight design method in reducing self-weight of MBS while maintaining their overall lateral stiffness measured by natural frequency. This is achieved by pursuing an innovative optimisation investigation involving a three-storey, standalone MBS with hinged inter-module joints, together with a comparative moment-resisting frame (MRF) benchmark structure with two different beam-column connection rigidities. Continuous-valued sizing optimisation of two structural systems under a single frequency constraint is achieved through a novel, numerically stable, iterative OC algorithm. The latter is developed from frequency-related OC formulated rigorously through the Lagrange multiplier approach. The discrete minimum-weight design is supported by a mapping strategy designed to round the continuous optimum to the most economical standard steel sections. Pertinent numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve significant steel savings for the adopted MBS without compromising its modal stiffnesses. Further, it is found that the MRF structure with semi-rigid connections can meet the same target frequencies with slightly smaller steel tonnages. It is envisioned that this study will pave the way towards achieving more resilient and cost-effective modular units and tall modular buildings that further support the building industry in meeting its goals of construction efficiency and sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:42","2024-03-21 15:48:56","","","","","251","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\F7T7FS6J\Wang and Tsavdaridis - 2022 - Optimality criteria-based minimum-weight design me.pdf","","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts to enhance the thermal comfortability of users in buildings can result in overheating if not appropriately designed, which in turn could lead to health issues as well as continual emission of greenhouse gases. To provide further insights into this dilemma and contribute to improving energy-efficient building designs, we undertake a new modeling technique encompassing a complete analysis of the existing building 3D model as well as solar radiation behavior on buildings. The technique involves 3D building information modeling (3D BIM) that is reconstructed using computer-aided design (CAD). Ladybug and Honeybee plugins for Grasshopper for Rhino are then used to evaluate environmental and building performance using the energy plus weather (EPW) file of Wuhan city, China, as a case study. An assessment of 'with' and 'without' built architectural surroundings contexts is also carried out in relation to summer and winter solstices. An overall change of approximately 29.56% is observed between 'with' and 'without' surrounding contexts, which suggests that both have a significant influence on the solar potential of individual buildings.

Despite its benefits, the smart building concept is still slowly adopted, particularly in developing countries. The advancement of computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) has helped building owners simulate and optimize various building performances in the building design process more accurately. Therefore, this study aims to assist energy efficiency design strategies in a building by identifying the features of the smart building characteristics that can potentially foster building energy efficiency. Furthermore, an ML model based on the features identified is then developed to predict the level of energy use. K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is employed to develop the model with the openly accessible smart building energy usage datasets from Chulalongkorn University Building Energy Management System (CU-BEMS) as the training and testing datasets. The validation result shows that the predictive model has an average relative error value of 17.76%.

However, to date, only a few examples and applications of efficient design solutions through 3DCP exist at the construction scale. Building on the advantages of the technique, the presented work introduces a novel approach for reducing the amount of material employed in structural beams through a high-resolution stress-based optimisation of their material layout in the longitudinal section. The paper presents an innovative workflow for the design and fabrication of 3DCP structures which provides design flexibility by implementing a set of geometric optimisation routines tailored to the concrete extrusion process, and which integrates Finite Element (FE) analysis at multiple stages of the development, for the definition of the printing path, the optimisation of the layer design through speed variation, and the informed placement of the reinforcement bars. The workflow was verified through the design, fabrication and testing of three beam designs which progressively integrates the developed methods. The strength-to-weight ratio of the three designs shows the impact of the proposed workflow, which increases the performance to almost three times between a full beam and the lightest tested beam. The potential for material saving through a design workflow tailored for 3DCP opens to more carbon-efficient and environmental production processes and structures. © 2022 The Authors","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:43","2024-02-20 10:42:24","","","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\I5H3RUVD\Breseghello and Naboni - 2022 - Toolpath-based design for 3D concrete printing of .pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2022.102872","Architectural design; Concretes; Carbon; Optimisations; Structural design; Fabrication; Digital fabrication; Work-flows; 3D printers; 3d concrete printing; 3DCP; Computational workflow; Computational workflows; Concrete printings; Load-responsive design; Responsive designs; Toolpath design; Toolpaths","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, increasing energy dissipation capacity means higher values of residual deformation. The goal of this research was to find the best design for a self-centering buckling restrained brace (SCBRB) system by balancing self-centering capability and energy dissipation. Three, six, and nine-story structures were investigated using OpenSees software and the TCL programming language to achieve this goal. For each height, 62 different SC-BRBs were considered using different values for the pretension force of cables, the area of the buckling restrained brace (BRB) core plate, and the yield stress of the core plate. The residual deformation and dissipated energy of all the models were calculated using nonlinear analyses after cyclic loading was applied. The optimum design for each height was determined among all the models and was compared to the structure equipped with the usual BRB. The residual deformation of the framed buildings was significantly reduced, according to the findings. Also the reduction of the energy dissipation was acceptable. The optimum design of SC-BRB in 6-story building has the most reduction percent in residual deformation, it can reduce residual deformation of building 83% while causing only a 57% of reduction in dissipated energy. The greatest reduction in residual deformation versus dissipated energy reduction was for the optimum SC-BRB design of 9-story building, results indicated that it can reduce residual deformation of building 69% while causing only a 42% of reduction in dissipated energy. © 2022, Earthquake and Structures.

A high-accuracy energy prediction model is considered as one of the most effective ways to understand building energy efficiency. In several studies, various machine learning models have been proposed for the prediction of building energy efficiency. However, the existing models are based on classical machine learning approaches and small datasets. Using a small dataset and inefficient models may lead to poor generalization. In addition, it is not common to see studies examining the suitability of machine learning methods for forecasting the energy consumption of buildings during the early design phase so that more energy-efficient buildings can be constructed. Hence, for these purposes, we propose a multilayer extreme learning machine (MLELM) for the prediction of annual building energy consumption. Our MLELM fuses stacks of autoencoders (AEs) with an extreme learning machine (ELM). We designed the autoencoder based on the ELM concept, and it is used for feature extraction. Moreover, the autoencoders were trained in a layer-wise manner, employed to extract efficient features from the input data, and the extreme learning machine model was trained using the least squares technique for a fast learning speed. In addition, the ELM was used for decision making. In this research, we used a large dataset of residential buildings to capture various building sizes. We compared the proposed MLELM with other machine learning models commonly used for predicting building energy consumption. From the results, we validated that the proposed MLELM outperformed other comparison methods commonly used in building energy consumption prediction. From several experiments in this study, the proposed MLELM was identified as the most efficient predictive model for energy use before construction, which can be used to make informed decisions about, manage, and optimize building design before construction. © 2022 by the authors.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:43","2024-02-20 10:31:15","","","","24","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15249512","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Decision making; machine learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Energy utilization; Energy prediction; Building energy efficiency; energy efficiency; In-buildings; Building energy consumption; Machine learning models; Multilayers; building energy consumption; Efficient buildings; Auto encoders; energy prediction; Knowledge acquisition; Large dataset; Learning machines; Multilayer neural networks; Small data set","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulations-based optimization is widely used, but it is a computationally expensive process in terms of time, as it requires a large number of evaluations of the objective functions. Metamodel-based optimization is an alternative to reduce the time-consuming simulations during the optimization process. Metamodels can approximate the building simulation model with analytical expressions. However, the accuracy of metamodels depends on the number of simulations used to train the model and the sampling strategy used to select informative samples over the design space. This study proposes an efficient sequential sampling approach to fit the metamodels toward the regions of the design space where their accuracy is higher and can improve all objectives simultaneously. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, it was applied to optimize the energy and investment costs of a multi-story residential building. The optimization results were compared with those obtained using a non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The results of this study show that the proposed method reduces the number of building energy simulations required by up to 50% while guaranteeing accurate optimization results. Fifteen energy-efficient buildings designs were proposed, with a wide range of trade-offs between energy and investment costs.

One promising approach is the integration of flat panel photobioreactors into building envelope systems and the BIQ (Bio-Intelligent Quotient) house is the state-of-the-art case building; however, the additional costs for glazing systems to contain photobioreactors, complexity of controlling cultures for microalgae growth, and difficulty of providing indoor environmental quality have kept flat panel photobioreactor systems from being applied widely. If we are able to bring about pleasant physical comforts for occupants through the use of shading devices capable of functioning as the photobioreactors, we can not only grow microalgae but also use less operational energy input to provide better IEQ for occupants. To this end, this study has explored a way to optimize the physical and functional properties of photobioreactor (for Chlorella sp.)-integrated shading devices (specifically vertical louvers). To find the optimal shape for static vertical louvers to be positioned on the west-facing facade, parametric design studies were conducted. To find the optimal vertical louver geometry among numerous alternatives, computer simulations were conducted in terms of three performance criteria (thermal balance by solar radiation, Daylight Autonomy, and microalgae growth rate) and an optimal option was found with the genetic algorithm optimization solver. To ensure reliability of the computer simulation (including numerical model) results, a series of experiments was conducted under the analogous climatic conditions; the computer simulation results were validated with the experimental data. When it comes to hourly indoor illuminance performance, the error between experimental data and computer simulation results was within a range of 5–20%; for average microalgae growth rate, the error was up to 19.9%. Despite the relatively high error between the simulation results and measurements, considering ever-changing light intensity conditions in our measurement compared to that of the computer simulation, it was justifiable to utilize the computer simulation results for the current parametric design study. Finally, the biofuel energy production from the proposed static envelope system was estimated to be 16.5 kWh/m2yr, which is smaller than the state-of-the-art annual biofuel energy production (30.0 kWh/m2yr) from the BIQ house. Nevertheless, the results are promising, given that we used the worst cultivation conditions for the microalgae in the current study. © 2022, College Publishing.

Improperly sized battery energy storage (BES), diesel generator (DG), and photovoltaic (PV) panels can lead to unreasonable installation, operation and maintenance costs, and environmental pollution. One of the major challenges for sustainable energy systems in zero energy building is having an efficient strategy, economical, and optimal design to improving the cost-effectiveness and reliability of the system. This paper concentrates on optimal design of the standalone PV/BES and PV/BES/DG based on efficient EMS for smart building electrification in remote areas. Initially, a comprehensive optimization model based on efficient EMS is established to seek the optimal design parameters with the minimum total cost and the maximum reliability of the system (RS) under sustainable energy indicators.

Design/methodology/approach: A 4D BIM estimation process was first developed by applying the resource specification and geometric information from the BIM model. A suite of OA including particle swarm optimization, ant colony, differential evolution and genetic algorithm were developed and compared in order to facilitate and automate the estimation process. The developed processes and porotypes were linked and integrated. Findings: The OA-based automated 4D BIM estimation prototype was developed and validated through a real-life construction project. Different OAs were applied and compared, and the genetic algorithm was found as the best performing one. The prototype was successfully linked with BIM timeliner application. By using this approach, the start and finish dates of all object-based activities are developed, and the project completion time is automatically estimated.

Existing studies on crowd flow characteristics at building evacuation bottlenecks usually focus on plane exit, but insufficient attention has been paid to the characteristics of crowd flow at the convex exit. Convex exit can be considered as such a structure like a double-bottleneck linked passage. This paper aims to study the influence of geometric structure characteristics of the convex exit on crowd evacuation and put forward the optimal design strategy of this structure, so as to improve the efficiency of evacuation in an emergency. Using social force model-based software, MassMotion, it is found that convex exit is indeed more efficient and safer than common plane exit in terms of evacuation time and pedestrians’ congestion, especially when the desired speed is relatively higher, indicating that convex exits are more suitable for crowd evacuation in case of emergency. Four size-related parameters of convex exit are analyzed in detail, namely the width of the bottleneck at passage (Wp), the passage width (W), the passage length (L), and the exit width (We), to find out the optimum design of convex exit. The research shows that the optimal size ratio is that Wp:W:L:We equals 1.5:1.75:3.5:1, and as the overall magnification of building size and the number of pedestrians increases, the evacuation time gradually tends to a stable value, which indicates that this optimal ratio has good adaptability in size effect. Finally, based on the in-depth mechanism of pedestrian flow at the convex exit, three possible application scenarios are proposed to illustrate the feasible optimum design of the convex exit. The results of this study can provide new ideas for research on the structure of building exits. © 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:44","2024-02-20 10:41:09","","669-684","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-021-0858-8","Architectural design; Structural design; Structural optimization; Optimum designs; Design optimization; Building evacuation; convex exit; Convex exit; crowd evacuation; Crowd evacuation; Crowd flows; design optimization; Evacuation time; Flow characteristic; Massmotion; MassMotion; social force model; Social force models; Traffic congestion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite being beneficial at the first glance, over-implementation of these options can impose unavoidable burdens on environment, economy, and society, specifically regarding their construction and demolition waste (C&DW) disposal. To remedy this issue, simultaneous incorporation of all C&DW impact categories into energy-optimized designs is the ideal comprehensive solution. However, such approach concludes in resolving a complex multi-objective optimization problem with several objectives. Therefore, the present study proposed a conceptual sustainability-oriented model that benefits from a novel accumulated negative sustainability indicator (ANSI) with a strong potential of justifying all C&DW impact categories into one quantitative indicator. ANSI can be applied in conjunction with other energy-related indicators in an optimization structure and result in design solutions that not only are energy-efficient but also have minimum adverse impacts on sustainability in post-demolition era. A case-study under different scenarios has been performed to elucidate and evaluate the applicability and validity of the proposed model. The results showed its remarkable potential in performing as a strong alternative for the outlined complex multi-objective optimization with 9% variation in electricity demand.

GEOTABS combines GSHP systems (which generate heating and cooling) and TABS (thermally activated building structure) systems as storage-integrated emission systems. GEOTABS has been proposed to improve GSHP performance while potentially decreasing investment cost. Moreover, implementing a secondary system in parallel with GEOTABS extends the applicability of these systems to a larger variety of buildings. This combination is referred to as hybridGEOTABS. The dynamic behavior of TABS introduces challenges in the design of these systems including a) thermal comfort uncertainty (typically when fast disturbances occur), b) determining optimal load split between GEOTABS and the secondary system, and c) complexity in sizing the production units. In this paper, a novel dynamic simulation-based design methodology is proposed. The methodology incorporates advantages of TABS such as load-shifting and peak-shaving and produces Pareto optimal solutions. The methodology is applied to nine case studies with variable electricity prices and carbon emission dioxide factors. Results show that the optimal load split is found near the maximum physically possible share of GEOTABS. Consequently, the near-optimal design of hybridGEOTABS can be achieved using simple guidelines without solving an optimization problem. Moreover, the results show that GEOTABS always provides carbon dioxide emission savings of up to 85% but requires higher investment costs of up to 238% that of conventional systems. However, due to the operational cost savings of up to 76%, the use of GEOTABS achieved net present cost (NPC) savings of 2% to 19% in five out of the nine case studies, for 25 years of operation. Finally, it was observed that this NPC is highly sensitive to building design and economic parameters. Hence, an early-stage design analysis with iterations between the HVAC designer and the architect should be performed using case-specific economic parameter values. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:44","2024-02-20 10:05:44","","","","","257","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","","Architectural design; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Emission control; Building structure; Investments; Pareto principle; Air conditioning; Global warming; Geothermal heat pumps; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cooling systems; Emission reduction; Thermally activated; CO2 emission reduction; Cost-optimal design; CO 2 emission; GSHP; hybridGEOTABS; HybridGEOTABS; TABS; Thermally activated building structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The retrofit process of an existing building envelope involves the design team selecting the best performing building materials and components based on various design variables and predefined design objectives. Worldwide, an overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) metric has been developed and used for assessing heat transfer through the building envelope. However, the application of OTTV implicates dealing with many design variables and much information, which makes the design decision-making process time-consuming and complicated. Furthermore, selecting the most appropriate design alternative in terms of OTTV performance while considering the most cost-effective design option could be a very challenging task. Therefore, this research proposes a method for retrofitting building information modelling (RBIM) to achieve a tradeoff design set between two conflicting objectives, namely minimizing OTTV and minimizing the retrofit cost. The prototype system derived from this method integrates BIM authoring tools (e.g., Autodesk Revit®), visual scripting (e.g., Dynamo), and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) customized in MATLAB®. The applicability of the proposed system is validated with a case study of an office building. The results show that the developed system provides a valuable design decision support system for retrofitting building envelope thermal performance while considering the retrofit cost. Additionally, the system shows an improved level of automation in terms of data management compared to the conventional methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:44","2024-02-20 10:31:51","","","","","256","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 20</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111693","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; Office buildings; Computer programming; Thermal Performance; Multiobjective optimization; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Artificial intelligence; Heat transfer; Building information modelling; Information management; Solar buildings; Retrofitting; Building envelopes; Multi-objectives optimization; MATLAB; Overall thermal transfer value; Overall thermal transfer values; Existing building; Green retrofitting; Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Visual programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little has been changed in the practice of urban street design. This paper bridges this gap by developing a framework of parametric simulation for design guidance of urban streets with an advanced urban canopy model that can simulate the interactive indoor-outdoor environment. Case studies are conducted at the neighborhood scale for six cities to improve outdoor thermal comfort and building energy efficiency in summer. The influence of street and building design parameters has been investigated based on 31104 simulations. Results reveal the conflict between optimizing outdoor thermal comfort and optimizing building energy efficiency. In the majority of the investigated cities, window-to-wall ratio, window type, and street orientation are the most influential parameters. Strategies by adjusting these parameters can significantly improve outdoor thermal comfort, as quantified by thermal stress hours, at a cost of increasing the building cooling load. Planting bigger and denser roadside trees always moderately reduces the thermal stress hours and building cooling load. These results demonstrate the potential of this framework to identify the design trade-offs between thermal comfort and building energy efficiency. The framework can be extended to various cities to help designers and policymakers at the early design stage. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:44","2024-02-20 10:41:36","","","","","228","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 7</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109815","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Bridges; Pareto principle; computer simulation; Air conditioning; Building energy efficiency; Thermal comfort; Global warming; Atmospheric temperature; energy efficiency; Parametric simulations; Cooling; summer; Outdoor thermal comfort; Thermal load; Microclimate; Urban heat island; Deterioration; urban design; heat island; microclimate; Outdoor thermal environment; Parametric simulation; Pareto optimality; Pareto-optimality; Street design; Thermal stress; Urban street design; Urban streets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the senior engineers can be biased towards solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process; however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types) to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this article, we present the development and validation of a genetic algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional conceptual design process.

By quantifying the combined influence of geographical and meteorological elements on building orientation, the concept of the total orientation-based mean temperature difference was introduced, and a method for obtaining the optimum building orientation was provided based on an equation for calculating the average temperature difference by orientation. By quantifying the coupled influence of geographical and meteorological elements on building shape, an approach for optimizing building shape designs based on an equation for calculating the optimal building width was created. We found that a linear expression cannot be used to describe the quantitative relationship between the average indoor temperature and building orientation. When the horizontal solar radiation intensity was ≤6.44 MJ/m2 d, the primary consideration in building design was the shape coefficient. When the horizontal solar radiation intensity was >6.44 MJ/m2 d, the building width was the main evaluation index, and the shape coefficient was the auxiliary index.

To simultaneously minimize the construction cost and the environmental impact, a green design model for PC slabs in long-span structures is necessary. In this paper, a multi-objective green design model for prestressed concrete slabs (MGDPCS) was developed to minimize both CO2 emissions and the construction costs of PC slabs. MGDPCS provides the optimized PC slab thickness, diameter and yield strength of the rebar, size and yield strength of the tendon using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for the input PC slab size and load. Furthermore, the effects of changes in the long- and short-side of span and tendons of PC slabs on construction costs and environmental impact are analyzed using the proposed model. Accordingly, we developed two indicators, that is, the environmental and economic scores and the eco-friendly coefficient, to evaluate the performance of the practical green designs using MGDPCS. To verify the applicability of MGDPCS, the model was applied used to analyze the designs of PC slabs in an actual six-story industrial building with a slab span of 10 m × 10 m. The results showed that the optimal designs obtained from MGDPCS outperformed existing slab designs for buildings by 8.12% and 13.62% based on the reductions in CO2 emissions and costs, respectively. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-03-21 11:52:49","","531-549","","5","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\I3I5D7L2\Choi et al. - 2023 - Multi-objective green design model for prestressed.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17452007.2022.2147897","5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 3_Carbon (CO2); 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 7_Building_Component (Floor slab); 2_Concrete (Prestressed PC Slab)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimization approach has been applied to obtain the optimal design solutions in five typical cities across all climatic regions of China. Design/methodology/approach: The method comprises a tri-optimization process with nine main steps to optimize the three objectives (thermal comfort, visual comfort and building EN). The design variables considered are four types of building shape (pyramid, rectangular, cylindrical and dome shape) and different envelope properties (insulation thickness [INS] of external walls/roof, window type [WT] and window-to-envelop surface area ratio [WESR]). The optimization is performed by using the Taguchi and constraint limit method. Findings: The results show that the optimal design solutions for all climatic regions favor cylindrical shape and triple-layer low-E glazing window. The highest insulation level of 150 mm is preferred in three climatic regions, and the INS of 90 mm is preferred in the other two climate regions. In total, 10% WESR is preferred in all climatic regions, except the mild region. When the constraint limit of lighting intensity requirement by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is applied, the rectangular shape building is the optimal solution for those with 10% WESR. Research limitations/implications: The method proposed in the paper is innovative in that it optimizes three different objectives simultaneously in building design with better accuracy and calculation speed. Practical implications: Building designers can easily follow the proposed design guide in their practice which effectively bridges the gap between theory and practice. The optimal design solutions can provide a more comfortable living environment and yet less EN, which can help achieve the sustainability requirement of green buildings. Social implications: The solutions presented in the paper can serve as a useful guide for practical building designers which creates economic and commercial impact. In addition, the theory and practical examples of the study can be used by building regulators to improve the energy-efficient building design standard in China. Originality/value: The research is the first attempt that adopts tri-optimization approach to generate the optimal solutions for building shape and envelope design. The tri-optimization approach can be used by building designers to generate satisfactory design solutions from the architectural viewpoint and meanwhile to find combinations of the building shape and envelope properties that lead to design solutions with optimal building performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-02-20 10:42:33","","1284-1306","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\R6MBCCCN\Lin and Yang - 2022 - Tri-optimization of building shape and envelope pr.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ECAM-05-2020-0327","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; Optimization; Design/methodology/approach; Energy efficiency; Building performance; Sustainable development; Bridges; Energy utilization; Optimization approach; Leadership in energy and environmental designs; Intelligent buildings; Thermal comfort; Energy efficient building; Insulation thickness; Architectural viewpoints; Building energy consumption; Building shape; Energy consumption; Taguchi and constraint limit method; Visual comfort","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, design and building construction should also follow the sustainable development principle. In this case, design and construction work based on the sustainable development principle should aim at creating a safe and healthy living environment, the economical use of natural resources, and the stimulation of economic development to create the welfare for humans and favourable natural conditions. The article proposes a mathematical algorithm as a comprehensive solution for engineering management of the planning construction site, from the calculation of the earthworks to the automated creation of the engineering geological cross-sections. The paper integrates engineering management, mathematical modelling, and BIM technology. The application of the building information model is undoubtedly one of the most advanced technologies used in the engineering management field, whose advantages have been shown by researchers. In the preliminary stage of construction and production management, decisions should be made regarding material and human resources, schedules, and estimates. The main purpose of this article is the optimisation of the excavation. Other issues important to the organisation and management of the construction are the planning of safe work on the construction site, depending on the soil type. Geotechnical sections allow ascertaining the need for additional fortifications and the depth of the fortifications for safe work. The paper describes the principal mathematical model developed by the authors to design a construction site using BIM technologies. It presents the main formulas of a mathematical algorithm aimed at selecting the objects used on the building site and the need for them. It also gives the main principles of engineering management and methods for selecting the mechanisms used on the construction site. Understandably, a specialist’s visit to the construction site will not be avoided, and it is difficult to present the entire current situation only with a review report or photographs. Using a photogrammetric model, the expert has the opportunity not only to visually evaluate the current condition but also to perform measurements (length, width, and volume) directly in the photogrammetric model.

As a result, diagrid structural systems became a current trend in tubular mid- and high-rise building structures for their significant lateral stiffness and aesthetic potential. Their unique geometric configuration allows the efficient distribution of internal forces that lead to optimal structural designs. However, existing design codes and provisions do not provide specific guidelines for their design under earthquake and wind loading. For this reason, this paper studies the properties of steel diagrid structures, including optimal diagrid angle, diagrid density, and fundamental period, as a function of geometric parameters. This study uses a large set of structural models with aspect ratios (H/B) from 1 to 4, diagrid angles (θ) between 45° and 90°, and diagrid densities (ρd) between 3 and 12. The structural design of each model is obtained using a soft-computing optimization algorithm, denominated hybrid counter propagation neural dynamic (CPND) model, that determines member sizes from a database of commercially available W-shapes following ASCE 7-16 standard and AISC-15 steel construction manual. This investigation confirms that the optimal diagrid angle increases with height, highlights the importance of diagrid density in structural design, and demonstrates the effect of the diagrid angle on the fundamental period. A new set of equations are proposed for: (1) the optimal diagrid angle as a function of height, and (2) the fundamental period of diagrid structures as a function of angle and height. The proposed equations allow the estimation of structural properties for the design of steel diagrid structures.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-03-25 13:20:23","","","","3","148","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\4MA5TIQZ\palacio-betancur-gutierrez-soto-2021-structural-properties-of-tall-diagrid-buildings-using-a-neural-dynamic-model-for.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0003271","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization; Fundamental period; Structural optimization; Aspect ratio; Structural systems; Design optimization; 'current; Diagrid angle; Diagrid structure; Dynamics models; Natural hazard; Neural dynamics; Soft computing; Structural properties; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy needs for buildings are a large source of greenhouse gas emissions. As the energy needs of buildings strongly depends on weather patterns, this paper investigates how climate change may impact building heating and cooling loads, cost-optimal efficiency measures, and renewable energy production. Eight locations (Stockholm, Milan, Vienna, Madrid, Paris, Munich, Lisbon, and Rome) highlight differences among European climates. Weather datasets, commonly used in building energy simulations, are evaluated to see how climatic parameters have changed over recent decades. A future climate change scenario (with uncertainties) is analyzed for the year 2060. Weather files are used to drive building energy simulations for a standard baseline and a (Nearly Zero Energy Building) NZEB residential building whose design is improved using a cost-optimization approach. The analysis indicates most currently available weather datasets cannot assure reliable results with building simulations. We find the energy balance in European buildings will significantly change under future conditions: heating will decrease by 38%–57%, while cooling will increase by +99%–380% depending on location. In future NZEBs, efficiency measures to reduce cooling needs and overheating will be favored (e.g. roof insulation, window type, solar shading, envelope finishes), illustrating how improving energy efficiency will be more crucial within climate change scenarios. Compared to the baseline, more efficient NZEBs will enable renewable energy to much better cover building needs. There will also be advantages from reducing winter and summer peak demand, particularly when coupled to short-term electrical storage. When solar resource is limited in winter, more airtight, better-insulated NZEBs improve PV self-consumption. © 2021 The Authors","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-02-20 10:05:45","","","","","240","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 58</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; building; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Building design; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Building energy performance; Zero energy buildings; Renewable energy resources; Building model; Building modeling; Climate change; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency measure; Energy efficiency measures; Energy productions; Nearly zero energy building; Nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs); Renewable energies; Renewable energy production; Weather dataset; Weather datasets; alternative energy; greenhouse gas; data set","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In hot climate areas, cooling load is the major contribution to the total energy consumption, so it is essential to adopt design tools to enhance the building performance and reduce energy consumption and emissions. Previous studies proved the impact of urban block morphology on indoor energy consumption. However, the performance of buildings in Sinuous Configuration (SC) within the urban block has not been investigated in previous literature. This study aims to find the impact of SC of urban block configuration on outdoor microclimate parameters and indoor energy consumption. The UAE climate hot conditions were adopted to explore the SC of the urban block on outdoor thermal performance and indoor energy consumption using two simulation programs ENVI-MET and IES-VE. The outdoor thermal performance in this study is expressed by; 1) air temperature, 2) wind velocity, and 3) relative humidity at the height of the pedestrian level, 1.4 m from the ground. The results show that the SC where the buildings are arranged alternatively within the urban block, reduced the air temperature by 1.9 °C compared to the base case of grid arrangement. This result was reflected positively on energy consumption by reducing the conduction and solar gains, consequently, the cooling load decreased by 4.9% compared to the base case. Furthermore, the SC has a clear impact on wind speed and behavior, as wind speed reduced up to 68%, but the airflow and distribution enhanced within the urban block canyons and alleys around the buildings. This study contributes to urban planning policies and regulations by providing an optimized urban block configuration for hot climate areas. However, the impact of SC on outdoor thermal comfort in hot and humid areas can be recommended for further studies. © 2022","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-02-20 10:42:39","","","","","163","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 15</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112507","Architectural design; Structural design; Aspect ratio; Thermal Performance; Energy utilization; Wind; Energy conservation; Air conditioning; Urban planning; Air; Atmospheric temperature; Cooling load; Morphology; Urban blocks; Energy-consumption; Aspect-ratio; Building morphology; Buildings morphology; Hot climate; Outdoor microclimate; Solar gain; SVF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the declining cost of technology and rising fossil fuel prices, the application of renewable energy technologies is promising. The worldwide use of photovoltaic electricity is growing rapidly by more than 50% a year. In the urban environment, buildings are central to human activities. Therefore, to achieve sustainable urban development, buildings are of particular importance for distributed renewable energy generation. Of different types of buildings in the built environment, high-rise buildings are of particular interest because of their high potential for harvesting a considerable amount of photovoltaic (PV) energy on vertical and horizontal surfaces. Nevertheless, this high potential is seldom harnessed mainly because the deployment of PV modules on high-rise buildings involves consideration of a complex interplay between various factors that affect the installation of PV modules (e.g., urban canyons, self-shadowing effect, surface-specific PV modules, etc.). This renders the design of PV modules in high-rise buildings a complex optimization problem, one that requires a generative design approach. In recent years, and with the advent and rising popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) concept, the apparatus for the implementation of such a comprehensive generative design approach is becoming increasingly available. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there are currently no frameworks for the BIM-based generative design of PV modules for high-rise buildings. To this end, the present paper made a novel contribution to the body of knowledge by presenting a BIM-based generative design framework for PV module layout design on the whole exterior of tall buildings. This allows designers to consider the complex interaction between building surface types (e.g., windows, walls, etc.), type of PV module (e.g., opaque, semi-transparent, etc.), the efficiency of different PV modules, and the financial aspect of the PV system (i.e., revenue vs. cost at different study period). The results generated by the elaborate case study demonstrated that the generative design framework is capable of offering more favourable solutions (i.e., either or both of reduced costs and increased energy revenue) compared to baseline scenarios. It is observed that, in the majority of the studied scenarios, the optimum solutions favored a more consistent orientation of the panels (i.e., consistent pan and tilt angles across all the panels). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-02-20 10:05:45","","","","","258","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization; Costs; Building Information Modelling; High rise building; BIM; Simulation; Generative design; Photovoltaic cells; Urban growth; Renewable energy resources; Fossil fuels; Economics; Design approaches; Model-based OPC; Photovoltaics; Optimum photovoltaic layout; Optimum PV layout; Photovoltaic modules; PV modules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zero-energy buildings realized by the synergy of low-energy energy-saving technologies and renewable energy utilization technologies have become the ultimate quantitative index of sustainable buildings. Therefore, from the perspective of the development trend of residential buildings, near-zero-energy residential buildings oriented to zero energy consumption will become one of the goals of residential building development in China in the future. Recently, building performance simulation technology has been widely used for energy-efficient design. This study focuses on zero energy oriented residential building design, taking the integration of complex systems in terms of building design, energy technology, and economics as the guide, establishing the coupling relationship between the parameters of each system, and adopting a multi-objective optimization approach to find the optimal energy-saving design solution. Based on the parametric design tool of the Grasshopper platform and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, the study explores a multi-objective optimization design approach for zero energy oriented residential buildings to achieve the lowest total air-conditioning and heating load, the highest photovoltaic power generation, and the lowest investment cost. Nine control variables that affect these three objective functions are quantitatively evaluated and analyzed. The design process and analysis model for the multi-objective optimization of zero energy buildings are established, and the feasibility and technical routes for achieving zero energy for typical building types in different climate zones are compared and analyzed, providing a theoretical basis and parametric design method for the practice of zero energy residential building design across different climate zones in China. © 2022 The Authors","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:45","2024-02-20 10:41:03","","","","","368","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 15</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133169","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Emission control; Building design; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Parameter estimation; Parametric design; Residential building; Energy utilization; Investments; Air conditioning; Intelligent buildings; Multi-objectives optimization; Solar power generation; Housing; Zero energy buildings; High rise residential building; High-rise residential building; Economics; Solar concentrators; Passive solar; Zero energies; Nearly zero energy; Parametric design method; Solar photovoltaic utilization potential; Solar photovoltaics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hourly variation of performance, economic, and environmental metrics is evaluated to investigate the proposed system's feasibility for a case study building in India. The effect of significant operational parameters on the system's performance is assessed by observing their influence on levelized cost of energy, biomass effectiveness, solar and biomass heat load ratios, and levelized carbon dioxide emission. The optimum design and operating conditions are ascertained through a genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization approach contemplating techno-economic-environmental facets to be satisfied simultaneously. According to the results, the highest monthly heat and electricity produced by the CPVT system are 521.8 kWh and 593.4 kWh in May. The results further reveal that sugarcane baggas is an excellent option compared to the most commonly used biomass in India because of the lowest price sensitivity. The parametric study results show that increasing the generator temperature leads to a favorable techno-environmental condition. Besides, the results reveal that the increase in solar panels is not economically suitable due to a higher levelized cost of energy. The optimization outcomes demonstrate that the optimum values of levelized cost of energy, biomass effectiveness, and levelized carbon dioxide emission are 58.1 USD/MWh, 3342.3 MWh, and 233.6 kg/MWh, respectively. Eventually, it can be observed that the chiller size and mass flow rate entering the CPVT panels are sensitive parameters and the optimum range of the generator temperature is between 91 °C and 95 °C. © 2022","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:46","2024-02-20 10:05:46","","","","","340","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 24</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Multiobjective optimization; Economic analysis; Heat storage; Global warming; Absorption cooling; Environmental analysis; Biomass; Biomass-driven heater; Building cooling; Building cooling and power sysem; Concentrated photovoltaic thermal; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithm approach; Photovoltaic thermals; Power sysem; Refrigerators; Techno-economic-environmental analyse; Techno-economic-environmental analysis; Techno-economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the performance of these systems not only depends on good configurations but also on optimal building typologies. The design process of buildings-integrated TSSCs on a district scale reflects a complex multi-criteria problem, where several conflicting concerns from multiple stakeholders need to be addressed. Thus, the proposed method aims to support the multi-criteria decision-making process in the early-stage design of sustainable districts utilizing TSSC technology. The method contributes to the design of the TSSCs relative to district designs. Our method enables design generation according to a set of decision variables related to the district (roof type and slope, orientation, building height, width, and length), and TSSC (type, geometric ratio, separation distance between mirrors, modules number, and solar cell size). The method uses a parametric modeling approach combined with a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) that enables design optimization of the district and TSSCs in two consecutive steps. The two-step design optimization allows finding optimal district designs for maximizing cumulative direct normal irradiance (DNI) and minimizing the total energy demand, and TSSC designs for maximizing average monthly load match index (av.LMI) (a ratio of energy yield to demand) and minimizing the average covered roof area occupied by modules. We validated the proposed method in an illustrative case study of ‘Buckower Felder’, a district in the city of Berlin (Germany). The illustrative application shows that our method enables the performance-driven, generative design of both; district and building-integrated TSSCs and searches for the most appropriate solutions i.e., urban designs for maximum DNI and minimum demand, and TSSC designs for maximum av.LMI and minimum covered roof area. Results indicate that there is a trade-off between objectives, where district design with high DNI (>4500 kW/m2/h/month) reflects high energy demand (8.6e + 05 kWh/month). Similarly, TSSC designs ensuring high av.LMI (>1.0) require a large roof area (>47 %). Given these trade-offs, the method can meaningfully support the decision-making process. Thus, the method allows for large-scale integration of TSSCs with buildings at an urban scale and supports solar energy planning and energy transition policies for sustainable districts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:46","2024-02-20 10:28:08","","","","","326","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120018","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; algorithm; Economic and social effects; Energy management; Decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Roofs; Multi-objectives optimization; Germany; Parametric modeling; roof; alternative energy; energy planning; Building integrated; Decision-making; Solar concentrators; Solar cells; Decisions makings; Parametric models; Berlin; Concentrator design; Convex optimization; Decision-making process; Direct normal irradiances; District scale; irradiance; Linear matrix inequalities; Linear programming; Objective; Objectives; Two-stage solar concentrator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to create a national energy and climate plan, using these tools may imply a great deal of effort (time, cost, and human resources) to carry out simulations for the full set of different building types, construction, geometries, design parameters, and retrofit scenarios. Because of this, simplified approaches that can reliably estimate the impact of energy-efficiency retrofit alternatives based on averaged building stock characteristics could offer a significant advantage, especially in middle-income countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. This study aims to explore the energy reduction potential of a representative building from the national residential building stock by utilizing the response surface methodology (RSM).

However, the dynamic mechanism of the complex shading design has not always been well understood, which plays significant importance in the building performance of cities especially considering the complex environmental conditions. In this study, we aim to optimize the annual daylighting and energy performance of a complex, dynamic, origami-based shading system based case studies of a typical city building, which is located in the hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zone in China. A modified parametric behavior maps (PBM) method was utilized for performance evaluation. A multivariate function was used to describe the interaction between the annual operation schedule and three environmental stimuli, i.e., hourly solar radiation reaching the south-facing window, hourly mean illuminance of the room, and hourly outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Radiance and EnergyPlus were integrated into the annual performance simulation of the dynamic shading. Experimental data has been used for validation of the dynamic strategy. The results indicated that the performance of the complex dynamic shading compared to the conventional static overhang shading depends largely on the annual operation schedule on an hourly basis. Indeed, the dynamic behaviors of complex shadings can improve the daylighting performance by 91.5% and energy performance by 19.9%, respectively, for office buildings with a large window-to-wall ratio in China's HSCW zone. This study will contribute to the performance-based design of complex dynamic shading, and further help to improve sustainability in urban design for modern cities. © 2022","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:46","2024-02-20 10:39:42","","","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 8</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.104109","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Daylighting; Energy saving; sustainable development; China; seasonal variation; innovation; Built environment; urban design; urban development; Energy  savings; Energy-savings; dynamic response; Sustainable cities; City designs; Complex dynamic shading; Complex dynamics; Dynamic behavior; Dynamic behaviors; multivariate analysis; Parametric behavior map; Parametric behavior maps; Sustainable city design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the BIM implementation, a large number of event logs are automatically generated and accumulated to record details of the model evolution. For knowledge discovery from huge logs, a novel BIM event log mining approach based on the dynamic social network analysis is presented to examine designers’ performance objectively, which has been verified in BIM event logs about an ongoing year-long design project. Relying on meaningful information extracted from time-stamped logs, networks on the monthly interval are built to graphically represent information and knowledge sharing among designers. Special emphasis is put on measuring designers’ influence by a defined new metric called “impact score”, which combines the k-shell method and 1-step neighbors to achieve comparatively low computational cost and high accurate ranking. Besides, an emerging machine learning algorithm named CatBoost is utilized to predict designers’ influence intelligently by learning features from both network structure and human behavior. It has been found that twelve networks can be easily distinguished into two collaborative patterns, whose characteristics in both network structures and designers’ behaviors are significantly different.

Firstly, the multi-objective optimization problem and Pareto concept are discussed, the NSGA-II algorithm is applied to solve the problem of building energy saving integrated optimization, and the algorithm implementation of building energy saving integrated optimization design based on NSGA-II algorithm is given. Use incremental costs and incremental benefits as objective functions and make relevant assumptions to keep the model realistic while simplifying calculations. Second, a series of constraint functions are set up to ensure the superiority of the results. By constructing model assumptions, objective functions and constraint functions, the energy-saving optimization model is formed and solved by genetic algorithm. From the optimization results, it can be seen that the energy consumption of all the design schemes in the Pareto solution set is between 25.0 KWh/m2∼31.7 KWh/m2.

With the rapid development of the construction industry, this proportion is still growing. On the whole, there is a lack of analysis of the factors related to energy consumption and comfort in the process of building scheme design at this stage. In addition, designers have insufficient understanding of the theoretical system of low-energy buildings, and it is difficult to optimise the scheme throughout the design. To solve these problems, this research first proposes an integrated design method of green buildings based on building information modelling technology. This method integrates and shares engineering information, problem solving, simulation tools, architectural model applications and architectural team communication platforms, which can effectively address the problem that the current green building projects do not belong to each other when designing. The research also proposes a multi-objective optimisation algorithm based on the genetic algorithm. The proposed method optimises the overall design of green buildings, particularly the design of natural lighting, starting from the influence relationship between targets and targets and between targets and enclosure systems. To obtain the optimal effect, the virtual function of Traind was selected as the training function after testing. In addition, the model obtained a reasonable range of design parameters according to the energy consumption of the building in the uncomfortable time. Finally, the method proposed in the study was tested. The experimental results showed that compared with the overall energy consumption of the initial scheme, that of the optimised scheme was reduced by 10.46%; the natural light coefficient increased by 0.44%; and the pressure differeces pascal hours (PDPH) was optimised by 5.38%. The optimisation scheme can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the building in the whole life cycle and improve comfort. © 2023 ICE Publishing.

Although it is ‘performance-based’, the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his/her hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects. Meanwhile, performances of AROP with different template combinations are also rated. After that, AROP with the best template is also tested with incompletely drawn inquiry images. In the end, investigation results are validated by another building façade design case.

The RWSHP system is actively applied to large-scale buildings due to its stable performance. The application of RWSHP in large-scale facilities requires an accurate capacity design with considerations of building load, heat source, and environment conditions. However, most RWSHP systems are over-designed based on peak load of buildings. These design methods, based on peak loads, are economically and environmentally disadvantageous. Therefore, this paper aims to development an optimal design method, both economically and environmentally, for the RWSHP system. To develop this optimal design method, a simulation model was created with an optimization algorithm. The economics of the RWSHP system were calculated bases on present worth of annuity factor. Moreover, CO2 emissions were estimated using the life cycle climate performance proposed by the International Institute of Refrigeration. The total cost of the proposed RWSHP system that apply the optimum design method decreased by 24% compared to conventional RWSHP systems.

It also proposes a novel approach and optimization framework to identify optimal design solutions for contemporary buildings based on the parametric model determined by the most inspiring design and construction parameters extracted from vernacular architecture. The study is conducted in three steps: (1) reviewing the design and construction attributes of vernacular dwellings as inputs in the simulation study, (2) analyzing vernacular counterparts to study daylighting, and thermal comfort, and developing a parametric prototype model based on the most prevalent modern residential type in the region, (3) identifying the most inspiring variables and optimizing the variables of the parametric prototype model, to find the optimum options.

The optimization framework encompasses variables into four categories: orientation, geometry, fenestration, and construction materials.

To realize these integrated functionalities of louvers, they must be designed considering the climate and geographical characteristics of the target region. However, these aspects are typically not considered during building design in Korea, resulting in lovers being used as design elements with simple natural lighting control functions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to promote the integrated use of louvers by optimizing the louver angle according to the microclimate in Korea from the viewpoint of thermal energy use. We performed load and energy simulation planning and calculation and conducted optimization studies for the louver angle and range of motion for each region. The energy consumption in central and southern Korean regions was minimized when the angles of the fixed louvers were 45°–75° and 60°–90°, respectively. Kinetic louvers could enhance thermal energy management when installed at 30°–75° in spring, 135°–165° in summer, 75°–165° in autumn, and 45°–75° in winter.

Industrial buildings that allow changing production scenarios require flexible load-bearing structures and a coherent planning of the production layout and building systems. Yet, current production planning and structural building design are mostly sequential and the data and models lack interoperability. In this paper, a novel parametric evolutionary design method for automated production layout generation and optimization (PLGO) is presented, producing layout scenarios to be respected in structural building design. Results of a state-of-the-art analysis and a case study are combined to develop a novel concept of integrated production cubes and the design space for PLGO as basis for a parametric production layout design method. The integrated production cubes concept is then translated into a parametric PLGO framework, which is tested on a pilot-project of a hygiene production facility to evaluate the framework and validate the defined constraints and objectives. Results suggest that our framework can produce feasible production layout scenarios, which respect flexibility and building requirements. In future research the design process will be extended by the development of a multi-objective evolutionary optimization process for industrial buildings to provide flexible building solutions that can accommodate a selection of several prioritized production layouts. © 2021","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:47","2024-02-20 10:37:14","","","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 14</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\H2YRWL2C\Reisinger et al. - 2022 - Integrated multi-objective evolutionary optimizati.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103766","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Office buildings; Structural optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Layout optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Product design; Manufacture; Industrial research; Integrated industrial building design; Evolutionary algorithm; Parametric modelling; Industrial buildings; Parametric models; Automated production layout generation; Automated productions; Layout generations; Layout planning; Production control; Production layout","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic research framework is proposed to analyze the resilience of an MEP system and optimize its design. The resilience magnitude in this research measures the ability of the MEP system to keep standard operation when component failures appear. First, the MEP model in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment is extracted to a graph database by using Revit API, which represents the complex network of an MEP system. Second, the importance of the components and the resilience of the MEP system is analyzed based on the network theory and topological metrics. Third, the failure simulation is carried out by attacking the node of the system randomly and intentionally. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the design of the MEP system by adding new edges. The results show that: (i) the graph database is a good representation of the MEP system, and it can convert the 3D model to a format that can be analyzed by data analysis measures, (ii) the same component in the MEP system could have different importance from different perspectives, (iii) the proposed network is more resilient with bridge ratio index and average path length improved by 6.16% and 40.58%, respectively, and (iv) the proposed intentional attack strategy is more conform to reality, and it can cause more severe results to a system. The research can contribute to the implementation of the resilience design theory in the MEP discipline, and create a bond between the 3D model and data analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-02-20 10:05:47","2024-02-20 10:41:11","","","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.101902","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; Circuit theory; Data handling; In-buildings; Resilience; 3D modeling; Complex networks; Plumbing Systems; Attack strategies; Electrical systems; Graph database; Graph Databases; Information analysis; Intentional attack strategy; Intentional Attacks; Mechanical systems; Network theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research proposes a connection between two dichotomous principles: architectural complexity and structural efficiency through a hybrid of natural phenomena, topology optimisation and generative design. Both Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (BESO) and multi-agent algorithms are emerging technologies developed into new approaches that transform architectural and structural design, respectively, from the logic of topology optimisation and swarm intelligence. This research aims to explore a structural behaviour feedback loop in designing intricate functional forms through encoding BESO logical structure rules into the multi-agent algorithm. This research intends to study and evaluate the application of topology optimisation and multi-agent system in form-finding and later robotic fabrication through a series of prototypes. It reveals a supposition that the structural behaviour-based design method matches the beauty and function of natural appearance and structure. Thus, a new exploration of architectural design and fabrication strategy is introduced, which benefits the collaboration among architects, engineers and manufacturers.

Based on CEN TC350, life cycle assessment (LCA) indicators, and EN standards, the life cycle assessment of a building should be conducted in the initial steps of the design process. The main target of this study is related to the sustainability evaluation of the optimized structural designs by the various lateral force-resisting system to select the best structural system for a tall building. According to interviews with 28 experts, condition and location of the study area, and intensive observation, 12 lateral force resisting systems were proposed to design a 17-storey five-bay structure. Each structural design was optimized by the optimization modules of SAP2000. Eleven indicators were selected based on data availability, experts' opinions, and authors' opinions. The weight and effect value (EV) of changes intensity were calculated based on interviewing experts. The values of the indicators were calculated using an indirect and direct manner based on SAP2000 results. A technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach was employed for integrating the values of the proposed indicators. Moreover, an applied effect of changes intensity in each indicator (AECIEI) method, which is one of the simplified MCDA approaches, was utilized to evaluate the sustainability of all scenarios. After sorting all scenarios based on TOPSIS and AECIEI, the results of these methods were compared. The results show that AECIEI can apply the effect of changes intensity and critical indicator on sustainability evaluation; thus, its results are more accurate than the results of TOPSIS. The combination of the steel moment frame and the special reinforced concrete shear wall in both directions was chosen as the best optimized structure based on AECIEI's results. This scenario with sustainable value (SV) of 0.014 was selected as the best option with respect to ductility with a value of 4.17 and the emitted air pollution with a value of 20.40 Ton. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:48","2024-03-26 08:21:58","","","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\9N2A2JKK\Shishegaran et al. - 2022 - Sustainability evaluation for selecting the best o.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00482","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization; Life cycle; Ecodesign; Reinforced concrete; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Lateral force resisting system; Availability; Environmental issues; Applied effect; Change intensity; Changes intensity; Ideal solutions; Sap2000; Social and environmental; Social issues; Sustainability evaluations; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the background of low carbon and energy saving, the development of green buildings has become the only way, but its energy-saving design effect needs to be further studied. Aiming at lighting and energy consumption, this study carried out multi-factor optimization analysis based on genetic algorithm on factors such as windowing ratio, wall heat transfer coefficient, window heat transfer coefficient, window transmittance and roof insulation coefficient. Firstly, the theory and technical scheme of applying data mining technology to solve the energy-saving design problems of different buildings are proposed and implemented, including the design of new and existing buildings, as well as the determination of decisive parameters and non-decisive parameters. Secondly, computer simulation and theoretical analysis are used to optimize the analysis of the building scheme, so as to find the optimal design range of each influencing factor and the optimal design method of green low-energy building. Multi-factor optimization theory and genetic algorithm principle are summarized, and the heat transfer coefficient of external wall and window of the building is selected as the optimization variable, so as to achieve low energy consumption and enclosure cost of the building. Aiming at better thermal comfort, an optimization model was established. Finally, through empirical research, an energy-saving plan was designed, and genetic algorithm was used to obtain the optimal solution for maximizing the incremental benefits obtained by unit input incremental cost. The results indicate that the ideal incremental benefits come from a reasonable and effective combination of technologies, mainly from air conditioning systems and lighting systems; the setting of the benchmark return rate will directly affect the optimization effect of energy-saving plans, providing decision-makers with the optimal combination of energy-saving technologies. © 2023, Strojarski Facultet.

A large parametric study of building envelopes is conducted using building performance simulation and cradle-to-gate embodied carbon calculations in 6 US cities. The authors derive the total carbon emissions optimization for commercial office and residential space types using standard code-reference models and open-source lifecycle data. Comparisons between optimal total carbon solutions and (i) optimal operational carbon and (ii) minimum required assemblies, show the impact of under and over investing in envelope-related efficiency measures for each climate. Results show how the relationship between embodied and operational carbon is highly localized, that optimal design variables can vary significantly.

However, their design equations are more complicated than those of steel and reinforced concrete (RC) structures, especially for circular columns under eccentric loading. Therefore, the use of emerging data-driven approaches will help structural engineers ease the design process. This paper explores the use of data-driven design methods as alternatives to conventional mechanics-based design models. Five boosting algorithms, including adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical gradient boosting (CatBoost), are employed to develop predictive models for four different types of CFST columns (i.e., circular columns, rectangular columns, circular beam–columns, and rectangular beam–columns). These predictive models are trained using the most up-to-date and comprehensive database collected from over 3,200 test specimens. Reliability analysis is conducted to calibrate the resistance reduction factors for three different design frameworks (i.e., the US, Eurocode, and Australian frameworks) to ensure that the newly developed predictive models meet the target reliability indices required by different design frameworks.

Design optimization is identified as a proper approach to improve PV systems' techno-economic feasibility and tackle the challenges of exchanging electricity with the grid. This study uses a multi-objective optimization approach to find the optimum PV system design that generates electricity based on the aggregated demand pattern of commercial buildigs. The goal is to improve the correlation between the PV electricity production and demand patterns by optimizing the PV panels’ range of orientations and the number of panels on each orientation. The PV system is optimized to in a way to maximize self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS), and minimize payback period (PB) and load variance over the grid. The optimization objectives are examined in four different scenarios for commercial buildings located in the downtown Los Angeles, California. The results show that the demand pattern of commercial neighborhoods is somehow flat and has no spikes. Thus, the production pattern of optimum PV systems will be normally distributed around noon, with slightly higher production in the afternoon. While the system size is dependent on the objectives considered in the optimization, considering multiple objectives simultaneously leads to beneficial and reasonable results. The SS values obtained in all optimization scenarios range between 4.4 and 44.1 %, the SC ranges between 84.9 and 100 %, the PB is between 8.55 and 14.7 years, and the RMSD ranges between 1652 and 2418 KW/h.

However, there is no neither widely accepted NZEB definition nor a specific design standard to achieve NZEB. This study proposes a complete design methodology from preliminary stage up until construction to achieve NZEB. In the proposed methodology, unlike the other methods, design process has been split into 2 stages. Prior to reaching zero energy balance by renewables, Pareto front solutions related to building envelope parameters were found at the first stage. Subsequently, renewable energy systems, including PV array and wind turbines, were integrated into building energy model and pareto optimal solutions have been obtained for NZEB. NSGA-II genetic optimization algorithm has been implemented with developed code, to couple optimization algorithm and energy analysis software (Energyplus), in Matlab environment. Diverse climatic conditions of Türkiye have been used since it allows simulating heating and cooling dominated building loads along with the balanced loads. Outcomes of the study showed that NZEB designs that have excess energy of up to 23 kWh/m2, 9 kWh/m2 and 3 kWh/m2 was achieved for hot semi-arid climate, Mediterranean climate and cold semi-arid climate, respectively. It was also revealed that although the share of renewable energy equipment in the initial investment cost, which corresponds to an average of 19% of overall initial cost, is not too high, the influence of renewable systems on both achieving the net energy balance and reducing LCC is very significant. Besides, the payback period of integrating renewables for NZEB is around 3.5 years if the proposed methodology is followed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:48","2024-02-20 10:35:43","","","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105103","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Costs; Energy utilization; Investments; Pareto principle; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle cost; Energy; Climate models; Zero energy buildings; Renewable energy resources; MATLAB; Renewable energies; Renewables; Climate condition; Pareto front; Energy-consumption; Integrated energy systems; Semi-arid climate; Energy balance; Pareto front solution; Pareto front solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The low computational cost of this model allows for the full mapping of the influence of all design parameters on the value of the system, while demonstrating less than 7% error in predicting the performance of a benchmark experimental system. It is observed that the location and building geometry have significant influences on the relative values of heat, daylighting, and power production, with the overall combined value varying by up to 40% between the compared climates. The optimal design in many locations depend on user preferences as well, with many efficient solutions possible for varying trade-offs between the values of natural light vs. energy savings (a difference of up to 50%), as well as the system upfront cost vs. performance, further reinforcing the importance of tailored building-specific design for BIPV solar shades. © 2022 International Solar Energy Society","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:48","2024-02-20 10:39:05","","191-200","","","242","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2022.07.007","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; design; Benchmarking; building; Economic and social effects; Multi-objective optimization; Office buildings; Multiobjective optimization; Location; Energy conservation; experimental study; heating; Daylighting; Multi-objectives optimization; Solar power generation; cooling; photovoltaic system; Building integrated photovoltaic; Passive solar; geometry; Photovoltaics; power generation; Building integrated photovoltaic building-integrated photovoltaic; Building Integrated Photovoltaics BIPV; Computational modeling; Computational modelling; Photovoltaic design; Photovoltaic solar shade; Power production; shading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many contextual factors, such as occupancy, mechanical system and interior design, have a significant impact on occupant behavior. Most previous studies have built data-driven behavior models, which have limited scalability and generalization capability. Our investigation built a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) model for the behavior of adjusting the thermostat and clothing level. Occupant behavior was modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The action and state space in the MDP contained occupant behavior and various impact parameters. The goal of the occupant behavior was a more comfortable environment, and we modelled the reward for the adjustment action as the absolute difference in the thermal sensation vote (TSV) before and after the action. We used Q-learning to train the RL model in MATLAB and validated the model with collected data. After training, the model predicted the behavior of adjusting the thermostat set point with R2 from 0.75 to 0.8, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was less than 1.1 °C (2 °F) in an office building. This study also transferred the behavior knowledge of the RL model to other office buildings with different HVAC control systems. The transfer learning model predicted the occupant behavior with R2 from 0.73 to 0.8, and the MAE was less than 1.1 °C (2 °F) most of the time. Going from office buildings to residential buildings, the transfer learning model also had an R2 over 0.6. Therefore, the RL model combined with transfer learning was able to predict the building occupant behavior accurately with good scalability, and without the need for data collection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:48","2024-02-20 10:05:48","","","","","238","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 43</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Control systems; Office buildings; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Neural networks; Neural-networks; Building performance simulations; Reinforcement learning; Thermal comfort; Thermal; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; MATLAB; Building performance simulation; Air temperature; Artificial neural network; Occupants behaviours; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning models; Thermostat set point; Thermostats; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In architectural design it is important to design structures that are safe in a range of wind directions and speeds. For this reason, the computational models used to design buildings and bridges must account for the uncertainties associated with the interaction between the structure and wind. In order to use the numerical simulations for the design, the numerical models must be validated by experi-mental data, and uncertainties contained in the experiments should also be taken into account. Uncertainty Quantifi-cation has been increasingly used for CFD simulations to consider such uncertainties. Typically, CFD simulations are computationally expensive, motivating the increased interest in multi-fidelity methods due to their ability to lev-erage limited data sets of high-fidelity data with evaluations of more computationally inexpensive models. Previous-ly, the multi-fidelity framework has been applied to CFD simulations for the purposes of optimization, rather than for the statistical assessment of candidate design. In this paper MF-NIPC method is applied to flow around a rectan-gular 5:1 cylinder, which has been thoroughly investigated for architectural design. The purpose of UQ is validation of numerical simulation results with experimental data, therefore the radius of curvature of the rectangular cylinder corners and the angle of attack are considered to be random variables, which are known to contain uncertainties when wind tunnel tests are carried out. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are solved by a solver that employs the Finite Element Method (FEM) for two turbulence modeling approaches of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations: Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) and the Large Eddy simulation (LES). The results of the uncertainty analysis with CFD are compared to experimental data in terms of time-averaged pressure coefficients and bulk parameters.

A large-space building shape optimization method was developed based on the “modeling-calculation-optimization” process to transform the “black box” mode in traditional design into a “white box” mode. First, a two-level node control system containing core space variables and envelope variables is employed to construct a parametric model of the shape of a large-space building. Second, three key indicators, i.e., annual solar radiation, surface coefficient, and space efficiency, are used to representatively quantify the performance in terms of sunlight capture, energy efficiency, and space utilization. Finally, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to iteratively optimize the building shape, and the Pareto Frontier formed by the optimization results provides the designer with sufficient alternatives and can be used to assess the performance of different shapes. Further comparative analysis of the optimization results can reveal the typical shape characteristics of the optimized solutions and potentially determine the key variables affecting building performance. In a case study of six large-space buildings with typical shapes, the solar radiation of the optimized building shape solutions was 13.58–39.74% higher than that of reference buildings 1 and 3; compared with reference buildings 2 and 4, the optimized solutions also achieved an optimal balance of the three key indicators. The results show that the optimization method can effectively improve the comprehensive performance of buildings. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Wang, Chen and Zhang.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:49","2024-02-20 10:39:03","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.744974","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Energy efficiency; Multiobjective optimization; multi-objective optimization; Optimization method; Solar radiation; Early design stages; Multi-objectives optimization; Building shape; solar radiation; Solar energy; Space efficiencies; Performance; building shape; Key indicator; Large space buildings; large-space building; space efficiency; Space utilization; surface coefficient; Surface coefficient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the characteristics of comprehensive perception and intelligent processing of the Internet of Things, a reverse suspension structure design model is constructed based on the finite element method and simulated annealing algorithm. Besides, deep learning is adopted to train complex functions for performance correction and to optimize the plane structure of shell structure. Moreover, the force is transformed into shape, and the form-finding process is completed to facilitate the operation of designers. Finally, the spatial anchoring ability of the geographic information system is used to match and calculate the relevant characteristics of spatial elements. On this basis, the index construction strategy based on weight distribution is employed to realize the data fusion diagnosis framework and enhance the intelligence of architectural design. The simulation results show that the maximum tensile stress of the physical suspension experiment is 3.71 MPa and the maximum compressive stress is 14.7 MPa. The compressive stress value is much larger than the tensile stress value. The maximum deformation value's difference between the compressive and tensile stress is 0.07 and 0.11, respectively. The error is within the acceptable range, which is similar to the compression state results obtained from the actual suspension physical experiment, indicating that the initial design model of the reverse suspension structure based on deep learning is reliable. In addition, the evolutionary optimization effect analysis results demonstrate that the load of the design structure is relatively uniform, which verifies the feasibility of the algorithm reported here. The research significance of the reverse suspension structure model constructed here is to provide an accurate and feasible design idea for the reverse design of some complex structures in the building suspension. It can also shorten the creation and improvement cycle of this kind of structure and optimize the performance and construction cycle of the building structure. © 2022 Xiwen Yu et al.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:49","2024-03-19 12:52:26","","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\DEWJPAQN\Yu et al. - 2022 - Implementation and Optimization of Reverse Suspens.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7544113","Architectural design; Structural design; Algorithms; Building structure; computer simulation; Computer Simulation; Deep learning; Data fusion; Performance; Design efficiency; Structure design; Design models; Materials design; Compressive stress; Deep Learning; Design programs; finite element analysis; Finite Element Analysis; Implementation and optimization; Simulated annealing; Stress values; Suspension structure; Suspensions (components); Tensile stress; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 5_Spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of high-rise optimisation but have been focused on the use of the parameters of single floors for the entire design; thus, the differences related to the impact of the dense surroundings are not taken into consideration. Part 1 of this study presents a multi-zone optimisation (MUZO) methodology and surrogate models (SMs), which provide a swift and accurate prediction for the entire building design; hence, the SMs can be used for optimisation processes. Owing to the high number of parameters involved in the design process, the optimisation task remains challenging. This paper presents how MUZO can cope with an enormous number of parameters to optimise the entire design of high-rise buildings using three algorithms with an adaptive penalty function. Two design scenarios are considered for quad-grid and diagrid shading devices, glazing type, and building-shape parameters using the setup, and the SMs developed in part 1. The optimisation part of the MUZO methodology reported satisfactory results for spatial daylight autonomy and annual sunlight exposure by meeting the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards in 19 of 20 optimisation problems. To validate the impact of the methodology, optimised designs were compared with 8748 and 5832 typical quad-grid and diagrid scenarios, respectively, using the same design parameters for all floor levels.

At the same time, Structural Optimization (SO) has received a lot of attention in the construction industry to reduce material and to enhance structural performance. However, the lack of communication between structural engineer and architect is a well-known problem discussed in the literature. This can lead to inefficient projects, thus increasing cost and time. The purpose of this work, thus, is to understand how SO can be inserted in a BIM project, specifically analysing the information exchanges between architects and structural engineers, to mitigate the problem related to lack of communication. The investigation included a systematic literature review to comprehend the current scientific scenario in these areas. It identified that there is still a research gap related to the adoption of SO to facilitate the communication between architects and structural engineers in a BIM environment. To help answer this question, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) structure was developed which maps the information flow to connect architects and engineers through SO in a BIM environment, aiming to optimize the information exchanges. By applying the methodology to three experiments of increasing complexity, the proposed framework proved to improve the collaboration issue beyond other project benefits, such as reduction of material consumption, improvement of sustainability indexes, and structural performance. Thus, the main finding of this study is that the connection between BIM and SO can improve the collaboration between these two players in the early design stages and, thus, it can potentially lead to a more efficient design process. More studies are still necessary to solve technological barriers related to software interoperability. © 2022 The author(s).","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:49","2024-03-05 10:11:26","","223-239","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\D2PEIVVP\do Carmo and Sotelino - 2022 - A FRAMEWORK FOR ARCHITECTURE AND STRUCTURAL ENGINE.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.36680/j.itcon.2022.011","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; structural engineering; architecture; Building Information Modelling; Engineers; Structural engineer; Construction industry; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; structural optimization; Sustainable development; Structural performance; BIM; Information exchanges; In-buildings; Information dissemination; Architects/engineers; information exchanges; lack of communication; Lack of communication; Model programs; Modeling environments; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 3_Stiffness; 3_Stress; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 2_Others (ABS Plastic); 1_Topology; 5_Others (Single story house); 6_Case study; 7_Entire building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The construction of the Jin Mao Tower 20 years ago was unique for several reasons and ideas have resulted in progress toward those goals. At the time, it was the tallest building in China, one that resulted in re-writing the Chinese code for wind and seismic engineering but perhaps most importantly inspired the design of other buildings that would incorporate resilient systems. These systems have been designed based on a platform of thinking related to life-cycle engineering and minimal impact on the environment. Clearly conceived efficient tall building structural systems based on mega-columns interconnected with cores, friction-fused seismic systems, the application of optimization theories, and the considerations of carbon in construction were all influenced by the design of the Jin Mao Tower. This paper focuses on issues from research to build work that incorporate these ideas with visions of future opportunities.

The ability to manage the position, size and properties of many different elements make it easy to create and evaluate complete modular models at the design stage. Benefits of prefabrication include, among the others, decreased cost, minimisation of environmental impact, and reduced labour on-site. However, making structures and buildings suitable for prefabrication puts additional responsibility on the designer, who needs to choose the modular system, partition the structure and prepare detailed schedules. The article refers to digital control over modular design in the context of the increasing complexity of structures. It focuses on methods and tools that either reduce the designer's labour or provide him with information that can be used to optimise the structure in terms of efficiency or cost. The article organises the existing trends and presents three experiments on algorithmic control of modular structures to outline the differences in computational methods suitable for particular technologies: masonry, steel, glass and timber construction. The research illustrated in the article was undertaken in response to the need to develop construction technologies in line with the sustainable development trend. © 2021.

This paper combines evacuation demand analysis with a toxic gas dispersion process to create an underground space risk assessment model for toxic gas leaks. The emergency evacuation capacity of a subway transfer station in Guangzhou has been evaluated and optimized based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based simulation. A strategy is proposed in which the subway ventilation system in the underground space is utilized to mitigate evacuation risks during gas leaks. The influence of the ventilation system on the gas diffusion process under different working conditions during simulations of toxic gas diffusion is also analyzed. A comparative analysis is conducted to discuss whether to adopt the ventilation system. Then, the effectiveness of the risk methods when the ventilation system is utilized in different working conditions is also verified. An empirical model of the impacts of the number of evacuees and individual risk perception levels on the evacuation risk has been obtained.

The Passive House (or Passivhaus) Standard certifies such buildings that comply with its strict energy performance criteria. Achieving the Standard is very challenging for dwellings in extreme climates. There is limited knowledge of the Standard’s potential in Arctic regions, particularly the High Arctic. Through a review of the literature and energy modelling of a hypothetical dwelling, the challenges in achieving the Standard in Longyearbyen (78°N), Norway are investigated. Very low temperatures and 112 days without daylight create a high heating demand. Whereas previous studies measured actual building performances or used simple calculations, the findings in this investigation show the limitations of individual design parameters and technical limits of the building envelope. In theory the Standard can be achieved in Longyearbyen; however, the potential in practice is low due to the very tight margins in the heating criteria. The results show the significant impact of applying contextual (climatic) adjustments to the boundary conditions of the Standard. The investigation could contribute to a discussion on modifying the Passive House Standard for dwellings in the High Arctic and improving building design for the region. Practical application : Current knowledge regarding energy efficient building performance in Arctic climates is limited, while the urgency for improved efficiencies is extremely high. The modelling in this work shows the valuable impact of contextual adjustments to the Passive House boundary conditions; the impact of individual design parameters; and the potential for significant energy savings through adopting passive house principles for dwelling design in Longyearbyen or similar climates. This investigation could encourage new policy making, additional research and the development of an optimized Passive House Standard that considers High Arctic climate conditions, thus encouraging new energy efficient building construction in cold climates. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:49","2024-02-20 10:05:49","","307-325","","3","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Building performance; Energy utilization; heating; Heating; Solar buildings; Intelligent buildings; Design parameters; arctic; Boundary conditions; Building envelopes; cold climate; Energy efficient building; Houses; Mechanical design; Passive buildings; passive design; passive house; Svalbard; Very low temperatures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thermal performance of nano building material and its comparison with conventional building material has also been analyzed. The daylight factor was found in between 1 and 11% and 1–21% for the floor and wall, which is within the thermal comfort limit. The theoretical model results are compared with experimental values. The best building orientation was found to be 180° from the north or towards the south. Wind speed was found to be more than 30 kmph, which is used effectively in the natural ventilation of the building envelop. It leads to optimization of the room temperature. The heat transfer parameters, including the quantity of heat lost and gained through fabrics, thermal properties of nanomaterial have been compared with conventional building materials. The U value (heat loss coefficient) of building material defines building performance at a particular orientation. The U- values decreased to 8 times in-wall and 8.67 times in the roof of the building envelope compared to conventional building material. The model was experimentally validated, and there is close agreement between simulated and experimental daylight factor values with root mean percentage error of 1.24%.

Both of the two buildings are located in Nanjing, China, the hot-summer and cold-winter zone. Then WUFI is used to simulate and predict the changes of temperature, relative humidity, and water content of the two timber-framed structure buildings, to strengthen the theoretical analysis of the thermal and humidity coupling of the external walls, and to propose an optimal design scheme for the insulation and temperature and humidity regulation of the external walls. The main results show that the tested thermal conductivity is basically consistent with the predicted value, which prove that WUFI simulation can effectively predict the thermal insulation performance of the external wall. The two timber-framed structure buildings are both suitable for the cold areas, and the reasonable optimization of the design of the structure is the key to the insulation of the building wall. Timber-framed structure is proved to have good temperature–humidity regulation effect. The moisture content of the two timber-framed structure buildings is stable, and the annual temperature and winter humidity are within the appropriate humidity range, which indicates that the wall design is suitable for Nanjing hot-summer and cold-winter climate zone.

The optimal buildings are obtained through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) multi-objective technique. Unlike most of this type of studies, the complete design of the 3D frames will be obtained considering the slabs, beams, columns, and braces as variables of the algorithm that are used to calculate dead and seismic loads. For this aim, two objective functions are established: (1) the first objective function is the cost of the structural building that includes materials and construction; (2) the second is the ratio between the maximum inter-story drift and the allowable drift, which is the most common structural performance parameter used by the earthquake building codes. For the purpose of this study, several R/C buildings are designed in accordance with the Mexico City Building Code (MCBC) using NSGA-II. The results demonstrate that as the height of the R/C buildings tend to increase, the frames with BRBs are more economical having similar level of structural performance in comparison with traditional moment resisting R/C framed buildings. In addition, the application of the evolutionary technique based on genetic algorithms for structural design improves considerably the structural performance and is able to reduce the total structural cost of the buildings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:50","2024-03-21 12:12:58","","2097-2112","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\8B4RRFB5\Leyva et al. - 2021 - Multi-objective seismic design of BRBs-reinforced .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-021-02965-5","5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 3_Stiffness (Story drift)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a CRSBF, post-tensioned (PT) strands and shear fuses are the distinct features providing the self-centering and energy dissipation mechanisms. As a relatively new structural system, there is a need to study this system’s optimal design. Control co-design has gained interest in recent years as a class of integrated engineering system design methods as an alternative to the traditional approach of optimizing the structural design and sequentially optimizing the control system’s design. It considers the direct relationship between physical and control system design decisions to discover non-obvious design solutions that enable new performance and functionality levels. This paper proposes a performance-based control co-design methodology for building structures integrating CRSBFs that concurrently minimizes the mainframe weight and determines the CRSBF design parameters subject to design code requirements as the optimization constraints. The patented neural dynamic model of Adeli and Park is used in this research to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. The seismic performance evaluation of the proposed methodology includes a shear frame and a nonlinear 6-story 3D building structure. The 6-story building model consists of 282 nodes with 1,692 degrees of freedom. A total of 610 frame elements, 8 PT strands with nonlinear material, and 32 nonlinear links are determined without requiring high-performance computing. Results show that the energy dissipation mechanism effectively reduces the seismic demand in structural members.

As such, multiple studies focus on aspects of building energy consumption and occupant comfort optimization. The scientific community has discerned the importance of operation optimization through retrofitting actions for on-site building energy systems, achieved by the use of simulation techniques, surrogate modeling, as well as the guidance of existing building performance and indoor occupancy standards. However, more knowledge should be attained on the matter of whether this methodology can be extended towards the early stages of thermal system and/or building design. To this end, the present study provides a building thermal system design optimization methodology. A data set of minimum thermal system power, for a typical range of building characteristics, is generated, according to the criterion of occupant discomfort in degree hours. Respectively, a surrogate model, providing a configurable correlation of the above set of thermal system dimensioning solutions is developed, using regression model fitting techniques.

For this reason, the present investigation develops a structural design platform for reinforced concrete wall buildings that uses a deep neural network to predict the wall's thickness and length based on previous architectural and engineering projects.

As a second stage, a model was trained for the regression of the wall segments’ thickness and length, making use of a feature vector that models the variation between the architectural and the engineering plans for a set of conditions such as the thickness, connectivity (vertical and horizontal), area, wall density, the distance between elements, wall angles, foundation soil type, among other engineering parameters. The regression model results in terms of R2-value are 0.995 and 0.994 for the predicted wall thickness and length, respectively, proving to be a reliable method for the initial engineering wall definition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:50","2024-03-25 13:06:35","","","","","241","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 37</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\E9RWJSPA\Pizarro and Massone - 2021 - Structural design of reinforced concrete buildings.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112377","Architectural design; Design; Structural design; reinforced concrete; building; architecture; Reinforced concrete; artificial neural network; Building design; Chile; Deep neural networks; Engineering plans; Feature engineering; Feature engineerings; Floor plan layout; Floor plan layouts; machine learning; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Shear walls; Structure; Structuring; Neural network; Neural-networks; regression analysis; Regression analysis; Reinforced concrete buildings; Wall; Wall thickness; Walls (structural partitions); 2_Concrete","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owing to the requirements of the legislated regulations and environmental concerns, constructing energy-efficient buildings has become a necessity. Researchers working in this field have proposed various optimization techniques to determine energy-optimal design solutions. However, the proposed techniques require a large number of simulations thereby reducing the practicality and inhibiting the wider diffusion of the technique into the industry. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of surrogate models as alternatives to commercial energy simulation tools significantly reduces the time required for optimization, and a large number of buildings can be optimized in a shorter period. In this study, we aimed at developing a surrogate model-based integrated optimization system to obtain energy-optimal thermal designs for residential buildings in the most urbanized cities in Turkey under different levels of budget constraints. For this purpose, an integrated system consisting of a genetic algorithm optimization technique and gradient boosting machine based surrogate model was developed. The results indicate that the proposed surrogate model-based optimization system is an effective method of overcoming the difficulties of simulation-based optimization methods and it can be integrated into the daily workflow of designers. This study reveals the performance of the scarcely used gradient boosting machine based surrogate model in predicting the thermal loads of buildings.

This also stands for the design of supplemental dissipation devices such as multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs). Although MTMDs present several advantages over conventional TMDs, their design is a rather complex process. Thus, an efficient optimization algorithm is necessary to design large-scale MTMDs. This paper presents a powerful multi-hazard optimization-based methodology for the design of MTMDs attached to tall buildings. The total added mass is minimized, while the multi-hazard life-cycle cost (LCC) is taken as a constraint. To enable an efficient optimization of large-scale MTMDs, a gradient-based algorithm is developed, supported by a sensitivity analysis of the PEER-based multi-hazard LCC formulation. Material interpolation techniques are used to provide distinct design alternatives. The methodology is applied to a realistic tall building. First, a small-scale problem is used to compare the new methodology with classic evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework required less than 2% of the function evaluations executed by the benchmark algorithms to deliver competitive solutions. Subsequently, large-scale problems using different formulations are presented. Solving problems with 133 TMDs, the optimized solutions allow to reduce the multi-hazard LCC by 35%, adding 0.69–0.86% of the building mass. The results show that the algorithm can provide economic designs at acceptable computational costs, and the methodology can capture consistently the multi-hazard behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:51","2024-03-19 12:41:23","","","","","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GMR4I56C\Kleingesinds and Lavan - 2021 - Gradient-based multi-hazard optimization of MTMDs .pdf","","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Life cycle; Costs; Design alternatives; Gradient based algorithm; Hazards; Interpolation techniques; Life cycle costs (LCC); Life-cycle cost optimization; Multi hazard approach; Multi-hazard optimization; Seismic design; Sensitivity analysis; Multiple tuned mass dampers; Optimized solutions; Tuned mass dampers; Wind design; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 1_Others (damper); 3_Others (damper mass); 7_Building_Component (TMD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The schematic design stage matters a lot for building energy efficiency, while most architects nowadays are less likely to make energy efficiency design decisions in this stage due to the lack of necessary means and methods for analysis. An integrated multi-objective multivariate framework for optimization analysis is proposed for the schematic design stage in the paper. Here, the design parameters of the building morphology and the design parameters of the building envelope are integrated for analysis, and an integrated performance prediction model is established for low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings. Then, a comparison of the performance indicators of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings under five typical urban climatic conditions is carried out, and the change patterns of the lighting environment, thermal environment, building energy demand, and life cycle cost of residential buildings in each city under different morphological parameters and design parameters of the building envelope are summarized. Specific analysis methods and practical tools are provided in the study for architectural design to ensure thermal comfort, lighting comfort, low energy consumption, and low life-cycle cost requirement, and this design method can inspire and guide the climate adaptation analysis and design process of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings in China, improve architects’ perception of energy-saving design principles of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings on the ontological level, as well as provide them with a method to follow and a case to follow in the actual design process. © 2021 by the authors.

For this, we modify both the size of the solution space and how it is searched using three different approaches to define the objective function(s): single-objective optimization, bi-objective optimization, and tri-objective optimization.

The design and development of smart buildings is a complicated task. Every smart building is a unique structure from the requirements and characteristics standpoints. Therefore, achieving reliability and real-time adaptation to environmental conditions are some of the challenges involved in smart building development. Resolving these issues requires deep insights into control theory, machine learning, system specifications, and design requirements. To address this need, this paper proposes a real-time management system for controlling various aspects of smart buildings (indoor conditions, comfort criteria, security, safety, and costs), and also presents the performance specifications, design requirements, and operating constraints for these systems. The study aims to address two less-attended problems in the related literature of building management and control. First, only a few studies have attempted to include real-time learning of buildings' subjective parameters in the model-based control design. Second, to the best of the authors' knowledge, smart building management studies are primarily focused on optimizing thermal or visual aspects of buildings, and little attention is given to the simultaneous management of all building subsystems and objectives; i.e., considering buildings' physical models, environmental conditions, comfort specifications, and occupants’ preferences and safety in the design. Accordingly, in this paper, we combine machine learning with model-based control approaches to incorporate subjective environmental parameters into the building management structure. In addition, another benefit of this study is that it integrates model-based and learning-based control schemes in a unified management structure for controlling various aspects of building performance. The proposed building management system can be applied to a variety of smart buildings in which the building parameters can be monitored and self-tuned using a well-defined set of control inputs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:51","2024-02-20 10:05:51","","","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 46</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Environmental management; Specifications; Intelligent buildings; Occupant comfort; Building management system; Building operational costs; Computation theory; Computational elements; Design and Development; Environmental conditions; Environmental parameter; Model based control design; Model-based control; Performance specifications; Real time management systems; Real time systems; Smart building management system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the practical utility of radiative cooling for building applications remains under-explored, which requires not only rational design and integration of the system but also optimized control. In this work, we develop a detailed model-based framework for system-level integration of water-based daytime radiative cooling panels with heat exchangers and cold storage to cool indoor air for residential buildings. A numerical model was developed to simulate and analyze the heat transfer processes for the entire system. With this model, the effects of different system design and operation parameters were investigated in detail, including water flow rate, parasitic convective heat transfer coefficients, size of radiative cooling panels, number of heat exchangers, and operational schemes. We show that optimal water flow rates needed to maximize air-cooling are 0.001–0.002 kg/(s⋅m2), with air temperature drops approaching 12.7 °C for typical single-family houses in the U.S. Based on an energy and economic analysis, the feasible capital costs to practically implement integrated radiative cooling systems with payback period were estimated for different U.S. cities.

Industry 4.0 aims to realize production in batch size of one and product individualization on demand. Constant reconfiguration and expansion of production systems demand highly flexible building structures to prolong service life and reduce economic and environmental impacts. However, most research and tools focus on either production system or building optimization. There is a lack of holistic approaches that combine these two aspects. This paper presents a systematic design guideline for flexible industrial buildings towards the requirements of Industry 4.0, integrating building and production planning. The methodology employs literature research and a multiple case study based on expert interviews. The design guideline is presented in the form of a categorized parameter catalogue that classifies the results, on the one hand, into the levels of (O) objectives, (T) technical parameters and (P) planning process, and on the other hand, into (S) success factors, (I) suggestions for improvement and (D) deficits. The findings identify flexibility, structural design parameters and an integrated computational design approach at early design stage as potential success factors for integrated industrial building design (IIBD).

The building optimization is performed on the model of a building located in Niš, Serbia, a city with a Cfa climate according to the Köppen classification. The optimization is based on the NSGA-II algorithm and was run using DesignBuilder software package coupled to EnergyPlus™ dynamic building energy simulation software. The defined variable optimization parameters (X1-X10) include parameters of passive solar design, such as window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of each individual building façade, type of glazing, different façade wall constructions, and window shading system on the façades. Prior to the optimization itself, a sensitivity analysis of parameters X1-X10 was conducted in order to identify the parameter that has the most influence on heating and cooling energy expenditure and on thermal comfort. The Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method is used to create iterations. Optimization objectives are defined for two scenarios. Scenario 1 considers the minimum energy required for heating and the minimum energy required for cooling of a detached passive residential building with a sunspace, while Scenario 2 considers the minimum energy required for heating and the minimum number of discomfort hours in such a building. The results of the optimization are obtained through NSGA-II iterations according to the predefined optimization objectives and by varying the given structural and architectural parameters of the building. The results are presented as a Pareto front – a set of optimal solutions and optimal characteristics of the detached passive solar building. For Scenario 1, the optimization yielded 63 Pareto solutions after 4245 iterations. For Scenario 2, it yielded 25 Pareto solutions after 4393 iterations. Based on the hypervolume indicator (HV), it can be concluded that multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II for Scenario 1 (HV1 = 0.82164) performed better than for Scenario 2 (HV2 = 0.59855). Optimization results show that when designing a detached passive solar building with a sunspace for the Cfa climatic area according to Köppen, window-to-wall ratio is the element of passive solar design that influences energy performance the most. In addition, a detached passive solar building will benefit the most from triple low-emissivity argon-filled glazing, opaque elements of the building envelope need to be properly thermally insulated with thicker concrete or brick walls for higher thermal storage capacity, and no shading or the smallest possible awning size is recommended for the south-facing façade to achieve better solar gains. © 2021 International Solar Energy Society","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:52","2024-02-20 10:39:09","","1426-1444","","","224","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 62</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.06.082","Architectural design; Optimisations; optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; building; genetic algorithm; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Multi-objective optimization; Structural optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Multiobjective optimization; Residential building; Walls (structural partitions); Heating; Multi-objectives optimization; Climate models; Housing; sensitivity analysis; energy efficiency; NSGA-II; Serbia; Solar energy; residential location; software; Architectural parameters; Computer software; Hypervolume indicators; Indicator indicator; Minimum energy; Passive solar; Passive solar building; residential energy; Structural parameter; Sunspace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interdisciplinary and holistic approach is more important than ever before, and engineering science is required to adapt to global conditions. This article presents the results of research aimed at the identification of sustainability‐related parameters for kinetic green façades in the preliminary design phase and evaluation of current decision support tools. The authors carried out the comparative analysis of existing decision support methods and tools for sustainable development, used in fields and disciplines such as architectural design, environmental engineering, and structural design. The particular focus of the research was on the preliminary concept design of kinetic green façades. Specific methods such as forecasting and backcasting linked to post‐occupancy evaluation tools were also taken into account. Parametric modeling based on optimization algorithms was recognized as the most adequate method. As a result of the conducted research, the steps to be taken at the early design stage for sustainable façade design were identified based on the example of the innovative system of kinetic green façade. The first step is to determine the design criteria of the façade considering the factors related to climate, culture, environment, and special design requirements. In the next step, the design parameters of the façade system are defined depending on the aforementioned criteria. In the third step, system design and modeling are done. Finally, the performance of the façade system is evaluated. If the desired performance is not achieved, the designer returns to the 2nd and 3rd steps. These last three steps of the preliminary design stage of sustainable façade systems are critical since they allow us for the façade design optimization, which in turn has a significant influence on the whole building performance and sustainability parameters. © 2021 by the authors.

With the objective of minimizing building energy consumption and maximizing the indoor thermal comfort (measured by predicted mean vote or PMV), an NSGA-II multi-objective optimization model is established.

Currently, rebar design is performed at the individual member level with few considerations of the interference between different intersecting members, leading to potential clashes and buildability issues. Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) is a cutting-edge technology concept that improves the design for higher buildability by incorporating knowledge from downstream manufacture and assembly activities into the early design phase. This paper presents an innovative DfMA-oriented approach for rebar design optimization with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm. Firstly, activities related to the manufacture and assembly of rebar are identified to apply DfMA principles, followed by the proposed BIM-based optimization framework. Secondly, multi-objective cost design formulation including both the material cost and the installation cost is proposed, incorporating the design code requirements and DfMA considerations. Following this, key modules for implementation are presented including the rebar layout searching, the hybrid genetic algorithm incorporated with Hooke and Jeeves's method for optimization and rebar clash avoidance. The illustrative example shows that the proposed approach can generate a series of practical rebar layouts, and a trade-off between the material cost and installation cost is found, which means excessive emphasis on minimizing one of them will lead to the rise of the other. © 2021","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:52","2024-03-19 10:46:59","","","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\94B29LL5\Li et al. - 2021 - DfMA-oriented design optimization for steel reinfo.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103310","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Optimisations; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Economic and social effects; Reinforced concrete; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; Machine design; Design optimization; Steel reinforcements; Manufacture; Design for manufacturability; Design for manufacture and assemblies; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Concrete structure; Design for manufacture and assembly; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Material cost; Metaheuristic algorithm; Rebar design; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 1_Topology (rebar in the cross-section)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, most building models required for indoor airflow simulation have been manually created by researchers, which is inefficient and error-prone in modeling. To overcome this problem, this study examines the similarities and differences between the general standard data model Industry Foundation Class (IFC) in the BIM (Building Information Model) and the spatial grid required for indoor airflow simulation and proposes a conversion method from an IFC model to spatial grid. This method uses the rich semantic, geometric, and relational information in the IFC model to automatically extract building interior space, divide numerical calculation grid, and map semantic attribute information to the spatial grid. On this basis, an integrated simulation framework is constructed with OpenFOAM to simulate the airflow movement of the indoor space of the building. The simulation results show that the method used in this study can automatically construct the spatial grid using existing IFC models without re-modeling, which provides important support for indoor airflow modeling. In addition, the integrated simulation framework connects model construction, simulation analysis, and other steps through tool chain. This process simplifies the simulation operation, provides convenience for indoor airflow simulation, is conducive to the wide use of indoor airflow simulation in architectural design and architectural design optimization, and also provides reference for related numerical simulation research and digital city modeling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:52","2024-02-20 10:05:52","","","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Structural design; Numerical methods; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Air conditioning; Numerical calculation; Indoor thermal comfort; Computational fluid dynamics; Semantics; Airflow; Building interiors; Indoor air movement; Industry foundation classes model; Integrated simulations; Numerical simulation research; OpenFOAM; Simulation analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first can improve the speed of the process, the accuracy and integration of the outcome. The second can evolve the design knowledge of the various types of buildings in practice. This paper presents the “PCA-ANN integrated NSGA-III” framework that is a fast, accurate, and integrated solution for practical, erosive, and complicated building performance optimization problems, especially when the case study is a multi-type building such as a dormitory. The novelty and contribution of this paper exist in all three phases of its research framework. First, the dormitory building was parametrically modeled as a case study in two conventional dormitory building types. Second, an artificial model called PCA-ANN is presented in which problems that have a more complicated and practical case study with a multi-type building can be solved simply, integratively, and accurately. Third, the capabilities of NSGA-III are introduced and showed that it could be more accurate in comparison with NSGA-II, and then NSGA-III was integrated with the PCA-ANN model to solve the many-objective problem posed in this study. R2 score for PCA-ANN in the best-presented structure reached 0.99. In the overall best building alternative, energy efficiency and daylight performance for the whole year and thermal comfort performance in the free running period improved by 41.27%, 42.24%, and 15.57%, respectively, compared to its reference model. The presented framework can be applied and generalized to building energy optimization problems in practical and complex cases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:52","2024-02-20 10:40:25","","","","","305","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 36</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117828","Architectural design; architectural design; optimization; Structural design; genetic algorithm; Energy efficiency; artificial neural network; Building design; Multi-objective optimization; Optimization problems; Multiobjective optimization; Artificial intelligence; Design optimization; Thermal comfort; Energy; Case-studies; temperature effect; Multi-objectives optimization; energy efficiency; daylight; Daylight; School buildings; Dormitory building; principal component analysis; Prominent features","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In China, faced with requirements in building energy efficiency design standards and specifications, researchers have been using BIM as a platform for breaking up bottlenecks in energy simulation and design software, and BIM is considered the key to improve the efficiency of building energy efficiency design. Firstly, based on the trade-off energy consumption judgment method proposed in the 'Public Building Energy Efficiency Design Standard (GB50189-2015)', this study combines the BIM platform with an orthogonal simulation design adopting an experimental building construction project in a cold region of China, to thereby study the influences of different envelope structural parameters on cooling and heating loads. Then, this study analyzes the continuity and consistency of data exchange between different BIM-related software, through the modeling software Revit and the sustainable analysis software Ecotect. Finally, through the experiment, the critical factors of the optimized design of the building envelope are investigated and applied for the optimized design of the building thermal system. In addition, this study uses BIM to complete an energy efficiency design for a laboratory heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. According to the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: this study proposes a BIM-based optimized design method of building thermal system, which complies with various Chinese building energy efficiency standards and polices and can be used as a reference for Chinese designers. Also, the issues and challenges in building consumption simulation based on BIM technology and the application of BIM technology in the design of building thermal HVAC systems are discussed, and the development trends of BIM technology in China are analyzed. Building thermal system and HVAC system design are the key points of building efficiency design. The optimized design method proposed in this paper is of great significance to this system design. The optimized design method can improve the design efficiency of designers while complying with China's standards and policies. Therefore, it can save costs, improve the economic benefits of the projects and, at the same time, obtain an ideal building efficiency design. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Although some research results are helpful for the energy-saving design and transformation of rural residential buildings, there is no systematic analysis of the impact of energy consumption parameters on energy-saving, which is not conducive to further optimization of energy-saving design. Based on more than 200 groups of field survey data, a typical initial rectangle model of rural residence in the severe cold area of northern China is established, and the orientation, aspect ratio, south window-wall ratio (WWR), north WWR, and enclosure structure are five main factors affecting the energy consumption in heating period. The method to evaluate the heating energy consumption of buildings was proposed based on EnergyPlus and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) from different functional parameters. The climate conditions of four cities of three secondary severe cold areas (1A, 1B, 1C) in northern China are selected for the building model, and the change rates and weights of energy consumption related parameters are analyzed. The results from the energy consumption simulation analysis show that the weight of enclosure structure is the largest, followed by the South WWR, the ratio of length to width is the third, and the orientation is the smallest in the four cities, which provides a good reference for the prediction and optimization of energy consumption in the rural residences in severe cold area. © 2021 The Authors","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:52","2024-02-20 10:42:45","","","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csite.2021.101131","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Aspect ratio; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Climate models; Climate change; Energy-saving design; Enclosures; EnergyPlus; Energy-consumption; Analytic hierarchy process; Energy consumption parameter; Northern China; Regional planning; Rural areas; Rural residence; Rural residences; Severe cold areas; Weight; Window wall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, evolving building standards continue to strengthen the requirements for thermal performance to achieve the energy-saving target. Therefore, this study quantifies the interaction effect between building standards-oriented building design, heating energy demand in winter, and indoor overheating risk in summer. Building databases with different energy efficiency levels are generated using a randomly generated method. Uncertain variables include not only 13 design parameters but also the running state of natural ventilation and external shading. The indoor overheating risk is assessed in terms of severity and duration. Finally, a multi-objective optimization model integrating metamodels and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is proposed to balance heating energy demand in winter and indoor overheating risk in summer. Results indicate that building standards tend to aggravate overheating risk in summer: the duration and severity of high-performance buildings increased by 40.6% and 24.2% than that of conventional-performance buildings. However, window ventilation could offset the adverse effect, and mitigation of duration and severity can be up to 85.2% and 62.1% for high-performance buildings. Window ventilation can weaken the conflict between heating energy demand in winter and overheating risk in summer. As heating energy demand increased from 6.1 to 67.3 kWh/m2, the overheating risk changes little that the duration of overheating risk decreased from 17.5% to 15.6% and severity decreased from 8.7 °C to 8.3 °C. © 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:05:53","","987-1003","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 19</p>","","","Architectural design; Building codes; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Thermal Performance; Risk assessment; Multiobjective optimization; building design; climate change; energy codes; Energy saving targets; Heating; High performance buildings; indoor overheating risk; Multi-objective optimization models; natural ventilation; Natural ventilation; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Solar buildings; Thermal performance of buildings; Uncertain variables; Uncertainty analysis; Ventilation; Ventilation codes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FPA is characterised by simplicity in its formulation as well as high computational performance and it has been found to outperform other well-established algorithms in a range of diverse optimization problems. The present study applies, for first time, the FPA to the computationally challenging optimum design of real-world 3D reinforced concrete (RC) building frame structures after a set of appropriate modifications to its original formulation. To serve this goal, a new computationally efficient framework for the optimum design of 3D RC frames is developed that is interacting with the well-known software SAP2000 for the purposes of structural analysis and design. The framework is then applied to the minimum material cost design of a 4-storey and a 12-storey RC building in accordance with Eurocode regulations.

The direct energy consumption of buildings accounts for 20% of the total energy consumption in a country. There are difficulties in continuing the mode of high energy consumption in the traditional construction industry. Therefore, the future of construction is in the development of green buildings. In the life cycle of a building, the consumption during the construction phase accounts for only approximately 20% of the total energy consumption. Most of the consumption occurs during buildings operations, such as lighting, heating, air conditioning and the running of various electrical appliances. Therefore, this paper focuses on the energy consumed during the building operation period with the aim of optimizing relevant design parameters to reduce total energy consumption. The West Twelfth Teaching Building (WTTB) of Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST) is used as a prototype, and Design Builder is used to establish a model of energy consumption and validate the reliability of the model based on the data obtained from the investigation. Based on this model, the study takes the perspective of energy conservation to analyze ten factors that may affect the energy consumption of the building: the heat transfer coefficient of the roof, the amount of fresh air, the heat transfer coefficient of interior walls, the heat transfer coefficient of the floors, the interior temperature, the energy efficiency ratio of the air conditioner, the thickness of the outer wall insulation, the ratio of windows to walls, the natural ventilation starting temperature and the solar heat gain coefficient of the outer windows. Those factors are then ranked according to their energy-saving potential through partial factorial design tests. The six factors with the most potential for energy savings are selected and divided into 2 groups to conduct a response surface optimization analysis of three factors at three levels. The best level of each factor and the optimal combination of all factors are obtained to reduce building energy consumption to the greatest possible extent and to provide a reference for teaching buildings and similar public buildings (PBs) in achieving the goal of “green building.” © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:36:07","","","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 29</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106548","Architectural design; design method; optimization; Structural design; building; Life cycle; Construction; Energy efficiency; Construction industry; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; life cycle analysis; Energy conservation; High energy consumption; Air conditioning; Solar buildings; Ventilation; Public buildings; energy conservation; energy efficiency; Historic preservation; Response surface method; Surface properties; Building energy consumption; response surface methodology; air conditioning; Solar heat gain coefficient; heat transfer; Model of energy consumption; Total energy consumption; Traditional constructions; basement (building); conservation status; Design builder; Design expert; Heat transfer coefficients; Response surface optimization; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In previous work, a database of 165 Chilean residential projects of reinforced shear wall concrete buildings was built, which fed a regressive neural network model to predict the wall's engineering thickness and length values from an architectural 30-feature input vector, which accounts for geometric and topological properties, archiving remarkable results regarding the coefficient of determination (R2). However, a regressive model of this nature does not incorporate a spatial detail or contextual information of each wall's perimeter, and also, the prediction of other parameters such as the wall translation has a poor performance. For this reason, the present research proposes a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models to generate the final engineering floor plan by combining two independent floor plan predictions, considering the architectural data as input. The first plan prediction is assembled using two regressive models that predict the wall engineering values of the thickness, the length, the wall translation on both axes from the architectural plan, and the floor bounding box width and aspect ratio. The second plan prediction is assembled using a model that generates a likely image of each wall's engineering floor plan. Both independently predicted plans are combined to lead the final engineering floor plan, which allows predicting the wall's rectangles design parameters and propose new structural elements not present in architecture, making the methodology an excellent candidate to accelerate the building wall layout's early conceptual design. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-03-26 10:05:02","","","","","239","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 31</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\PDEJRLST\Pizarro et al. - 2021 - Use of convolutional networks in the conceptual st.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112311","5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 3_Others (not readable); 7_Part of building (Shear walls); 4_Others (not readable); 1_Topology (ML)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, climate change and variations in simulation parameters over the building's life span may impact the optimised design. A key question is whether a particular energy-optimised design under present climate conditions would remain energy-optimised in the future. Accordingly, in this paper, a new simulation-based optimisation method is developed, which uses climate models and Ant Colony Optimisation to compare the energy-optimised designs under present and future climates. To demonstrate its potential, this method is applied to a typical office building in two Australian cities, Brisbane and Canberra. The results show that optimising under future climate conditions can lead to different optimal building designs. For Brisbane, the energy difference between optimising under present and future climate conditions is small, but in Canberra the cooling load is increased by up to 6%. This suggests that optimising the studied office building under present climate conditions is acceptable for Brisbane, while considering future climate may yield some savings in Canberra. Results also show that the energy-optimised building configuration for both future and present climates in Brisbane is less sensitive to changes in the load scenario than in Canberra. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:36:38","","","","","231","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 57</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110610","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Building design; Office buildings; Artificial intelligence; Building energy; Climate models; Climate change; Climate condition; Simulation-based optimization; Ant colony optimization; Building configuration; Climate change impacts on buildings; Energy differences; Energy-efficient buildings in Australia; Future energies; Future energy optimized buildings; Metaheuristics; Simulation based optimisation; Simulation parameters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overall aim was to use a capillary heat exchanger to obtain energy in coastal areas for promoting renewable energy in low-carbon building design. Initially, the main factors affecting the efficiency of the capillary heat exchanger were identified, a mathematical model was then established to analyse the heat transfer process. The analysis showed the flow rate and the capillary length are the key factors affecting the efficiency of the capillary heat exchanger. Secondly, to optimize the structural design of the capillary heat exchanger, the heat energy transfer is calculated with different lengths of the capillary under various flow rates in summer and winter conditions, respectively. Thirdly, a typical building is selected to analyse the application of the capillary heat exchanger for extracting energy in the coastal area. The results show the performance of the selected capillary heat exchanger heat pump system, in winter, the heat energy transfer rate is 60 W/m2 when the seawater temperature is 3.7 °C; in summer, the heat energy transfer rate is 150 W/m2 when the seawater temperature is 24.6 °C. Finally, the above field test results were examined using a numerical simulation model, the test and simulation results agree with each other quite well. This paper is conducive in promoting the development of the capillary heat exchanger heat pump as an innovative sustainable technology for net-zero energy and low carbon buildings using renewable energy in coastal areas.

This paper explores the architectural design process based on the BIM platform and puts forward the structural design method based on the BIM platform. It carries out the seismic analysis of a high-rise building with a transfer floor structure and compares the analysis results with the structural analysis software commonly used by the current design institute. The results obtained for experimentation show that the period ratio, displacement ratio, and the first six modes calculated by the two methods in the modal analysis are consistent. The error between calculation results and PKPM calculation results is within a reasonable range. In the analysis of the mode decomposition response spectrum method, the seismic forces in X and Y directions, floor shear, overturning moment, floor average displacement, and displacement angle obtained by the two models are compared respectively. The analysis results of the two methods accord with the mechanical characteristics of the transfer floor structure, and the calculation error is within the allowable range.

The experimental results suggested that there is a similarity relationship between water vapor and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in diffusion through porous media. In this paper, the similarity between the moisture and pollutant transport and storage coefficients of porous building materials has been clearly established and explained. In addition, two similarity coefficients have been defined for VOC storage and diffusion to estimate the VOC properties from the moisture properties of the same material. A coupled hygric-pollutant (VOC) model which can be used to simulate VOC and hygric behavior of building materials under dynamic conditions is presented. The model which is implemented in the environment SPARK (Simulation Problem Analysis and Research Kernel) suited to complex problems using finite difference technique with an implicit scheme, has been validated with the experimental data. It is then applied to study the effect of toluene and moisture buffering capacities of a hemp concrete wall on indoor toluene concentration and relative humidity (RH). Hemp concrete was chosen in this study because it is an environmentally-friendly material that is used more and more in building construction. The toluene (TOL, selected VOC for this study) transport and storage properties obtained from hygrique properties of hemp concrete based on the assumption of the similarity between toluene and moisture transport have been modelled and investigated. At the room level, the results obtained show that taking into account the sorption capacity toward moisture and toluene has a significant effect on indoor RH and IAQ because hemp concrete contributes to dampen indoor RH and toluene variations. The numerical model presented is very useful for the building design optimization and can be used for a fast estimation of indoor pollution and hygrothermal conditions in building. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:05:53","","","","","188","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 10</p>","","","Architectural design; Concretes; Structural design; concrete; Humidity control; Storage (materials); Digital storage; Health risks; indoor air; Hemp; Hemp concrete; modeling; Moisture; air quality; Indoor air quality; Finite-difference techniques; Hygro-thermal conditions; Modeling; Moisture buffering capacity; moisture transfer; pollutant transport; Pollution; Porous building material; Porous materials; Similarity; Similarity coefficients; Sorption capacities; Storage coefficient; toluene; Toluene; Toluene buffering capacity; VOC; volatile organic compound; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Volatile organic compounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their market penetration is inhibited by lower costs of conventional technologies. Thus, heat pumps must become cheaper to purchase and operate. Investment costs are related to the design, while operating costs are related to operational efficiency. Although design and operation are mutually interdependent, they are considered separately in conventional design procedures. This disconnect prevents the full potential of the technology from being realized. In this contribution, we present a framework to simultaneously consider design and operation in one optimization step using a simulation-based optimization approach called HPS eOD Design. Based on a building heat demand, the framework optimizes annualized costs and emissions of heat pump systems considering the operational behaviour already in the design. By coupling the optimization program with a software for automatic generation of building models called TEASER, HPS eOD Design can be applied to a wide variety of building types and locations. Optimization results reveal that optimizing heat pump system sizing improves annualized costs and emissions for six examined buildings by up to 8.2% in costs and 12.7% in emissions compared to sizings derived by the conventional design procedure VDI4645. To exploit even further potential, the integration of operational optimization within the design is highly recommended. In addition, a more detailed modeling approach of the building should be implemented in HPS eOD Design. Both measures lead to an acceleration of the building sector defossilization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:05:53","","","","","251","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Design and operations; Heat pump systems; Heat-pump systems; Pumps; Annual cost minimization; Annual costs minimization; Applied genetic algorithm; Buildings sector; Conventional design procedures; Multi-objectives optimization; Operating costs; Simulation-based designs; TEWI emission minimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elastocaloric systems, based on solid state cooling, feature among the most promising alternatives. In this paper, an elastocaloric device for air ventilation (ECV) composed by parallel and serial connection of multiple shape memory alloy (SMA) films, is investigated via volume-based finite difference simulation in MATLAB and dynamic building simulation in TRNSYS considering eight cities across the globe. The models assume experimentally demonstrated thermal parameters for the elastocaloric phase transformation around room temperature and a single-storey reference building. The ECV operates according to an optimized, energy-saving logic that includes load partialization and recirculation. Parametric analyses suggest that moderate terminal velocities (∼2 m/s) and a climate-specific design aimed at maximizing the use of the ECV device at nominal cooling capacity are key to reach building cooling needs reductions up to 70% in the considered scenarios. Partialization results in enhanced energy flexibility and conservation, whereas recirculation extends the ECV usability to extreme heat conditions. In absolute terms, the ECV works best under hot climates (e.g. Cairo, Dubai, Brisbane), with monthly cooling load reductions about 2/3-fold compared to cold locations (e.g. Milan, Hobart). The performance is extremely sensitive to the ventilation rate. Thermal zones requiring 1 to 2 air changes per hour are best suited. These findings provide initial insight into design criteria, opportunities and limitations on the use of elastocaloric devices for building ventilation to guide future experimental verification. © 2021 International Solar Energy Society","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:53","2024-02-20 10:39:30","","298-311","","","230","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 5</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.10.025","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Carbon dioxide; Design optimization; Energy conservation; experimental study; Ventilation; global warming; Global warming; ventilation; cooling; MATLAB; Building ventilations; United Arab Emirates; Cooling systems; Italy; equipment; Energy analysis; Australia; Brisbane; Cairo [Cairo (GVR)]; Cairo [Egypt]; Cooling potential; Dubai [Dubai (ADS)]; Dubai [United Arab Emirates]; Dynamic energy; Dynamic energy analyse; Dynamic energy analysis; Egypt; Elastocaloric effect; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Queensland; Recirculations; Shape memory alloys; Shape-memory alloy; Solid state cooling; Solid-state cooling; Vapor-compression systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For decades, it is well known that mixed flow turbines are a seat of several loss phenomena such as the volute to rotor interspace loss, subject of this paper. Commonly, the meanline approach is the first step solution for building a preliminary design of such turbines and estimating subsequent losses. The accuracy of the code used in the meanline modeling is crucial for building an optimized turbine design with a minimized loss generation. This paper presents an improved validated meanline code, written in the newest object-oriented version of the FORTRAN language, for turbomachinery performance prediction. Unlike commercially available codes, the code allows the calculation of the rotor passage loss coefficient given the turbine expansion ratio without the need for additional test data. The standard deviation value between the code and test data is less than 10%, for all studied cases which ensure the validity of the developed model. Then, the developed code is exploited to investigate the effect of the volute to rotor interspace geometry on the loss generation and performance of a mixed flow turbine. Indeed, a performance distribution over a wide range of rotational speed and an energy loss breakdown are depicted and discussed showing a significant impact of the volute to rotor interspace. The results revealed an improvement in the turbine efficiency up to 2.9% with a volute to rotor interspace radii ratio of 0.59 at 80% of the design speed. © IMechE 2021.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:54","2024-02-20 10:39:22","","1511-1521","","5","235","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09544089211007023","Architectural design; Structural design; Preliminary design; Energy dissipation; Machine design; Performance prediction; Cascades (fluid mechanics); Electricity production; energy loss; FORTRAN (programming language); meanline analysis; Mixed flow turbine; Mixed flow turbines; Object-oriented version; performance; Performance distribution; Standard deviation; Turbine efficiency; Turbines; volute-rotor interspace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subproblems are iteratively solved instead of the original problem. The substructures are analysed and optimally designed, one after another, until convergence, taking into account the effects of other parts of the building to maintain the building’s integrity. Thus, the analysis of a high-rise building is accomplished by analysing a set of low-rise building substructures.

However, SSI is rarely considered in the design of building structures, and instead, buildings are frequently analyzed using a rigid base assumption and quasi-static loading conditions that ignore SSI and its dynamic nature. Acknowledging these shortcomings, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published in 2012 a set of recommendations on time-domain analyses of SSI for building structures compatible with standard finite element packages for consideration in engineering design. The so-called NIST GCR 12-917-21 report introduced a major simplification to enable frequency domain tools to be implemented in time domain analyses. That is, replacing the frequency-dependent soil impedance functions by a single-valued functions read at the flexible-base structure frequency; This work seeks to quantify the accuracy of this simplification considering fully coupled two-dimensional (2D) finite element models (FEM) as the reference. Using a Bayesian approach based on ensemble Kalman inversion (EnKI) and a range of numerical simulations of soil–foundation–building interaction, we estimate the optimal frequency that can be used to estimate soil impedance for time domain analyses; and we evaluate the improvement that the corresponding impedance offers relative to the full FEM results when compared to time domain analyses performed in accordance to the NIST recommendations outlined above. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:54","2024-03-21 16:13:42","","1955-1979","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\T2CHIVCC\Kusanovic et al. - 2021 - Optimization of frequency domain impedances for ti.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/8755293020981994","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Vibration (natural period); 1_Others (natural period)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urban morphology was integrated into the optimization process as the bridge between the urban design scenario and the actual urban block. To validate the model, this study abstracted basic urban forms from actual urban contexts to generate urban blocks with the Rhino tool and run optimization in the Wallacei X, for multi-objective optimization in Rhino.

In the results, the proposed framework can be validated feasibly with optimization of 100 iterations.

The approach considers reinforcement overlaps and congestion in beam-column joints and extracts 3D spatial information from design BIM models to underpin the automated clash-free optimization. The beam-column intersections are classified into appropriate categories such as T and cross joints, following by the generation of a clash-free reinforcement layout using the first-stage GA.

In residential application, heat pump systems typically consist of a heat pump, an auxiliary heater, two thermal storages (for space heating and domestic hot water), and a system controller. Compared to conventional technologies, the efficiency of a heat pump system is highly dependent on it's design, (component sizes, flowsheet, and refrigerant choice) and its operating conditions, particularly part load and temperature levels. While design strategies exist on different domains in the literature, there is no integrated strategy to optimally design heat pumps systems. In this work, we use process intensification to consider the heat pump system design and operation simultaneously. Formulating the intensification process leads to a two-stage MINLP optimization problem with multiple objectives: Costs and emissions. In the first stage, the design is optimized in an annual dynamic building performance simulation using a surrogate-based optimization procedure. Then, using the same dynamic simulation models, the system controller is optimized in the second stage using a Genetic Algorithm. Our results underline the necessity for integrated optimization process. The integrated process can decrease annualized costs up to 36% and emissions up to 51% compared to standard design procedures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:54","2024-02-20 10:05:54","","","","","250","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Design optimization; Radial basis function networks; Cost minimization; Design and operation optimization; Design and operations; Emission and cost minimization; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heat-pump systems; Integrated designs; Intelligent buildings; Operations optimization; Process intensification; Pumps; Radial basis functions; Surrogate-based optimization; System controllers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional displacement-based design is limited to simple displacement targets, with optimization techniques (GA), it is feasibly to consider more performance chrematistics (e.g. costs, serviceability, etc.). By formulating drift targets and other structural design limit states within an elimination step of the GA optimization process, the method proposed here optimizes rocking wall design with multiple criteria that factor much more than lateral displacement targets in the seismic analysis. This type of optimization is difficult to perform using traditional manual trial-and-error approaches. An existing simplified nonlinear time-history simulation model (validated through full-scale shake table test data) of a wood rocking wall is employed in this process. The design for an example building in Seattle with a six-story rocking wall is presented using the proposed procedure. The results revealed that the optimization of the mass timber rocking wall lateral system can be achieved in a reasonable time frame using the proposed method. Even though the same drift limits were applied, final designs produced by GA varied, depending on the other optimization objectives. This demonstrates how the seismic design of wood rocking wall systems could be readily improved with computerized optimization tools that factor in other aspects of the design including cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:54","2024-03-25 13:31:19","","","","","229","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\LJAN9DIP\Huang et al. - 2021 - Optimizing displacement-based seismic design of ma.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111603","1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Timber; 7_Part of Building (Lateral system); 3_Vibration (acceleration)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The POE offers an opportunity to investigate the buildings' actual performance based upon the occupants' satisfaction levels in the aspects of building overall design, indoor environmental quality, thermal comfort, etc. However, as the key part of POE, occupant satisfaction assessment (OSA) is a missing link in the building performance evaluation (BPE) domain, and there is not a systematic evaluation method for the OSA. Moreover, it is time-consuming and error-prone to conduct the OSA manually. This paper presents from the end-user's satisfaction perspective a semantic post-occupancy evaluation ontology (POEontology) to facilitate the occupant satisfaction assessment of buildings, with the ultimate aim of optimizing building operation guidelines, and improving occupants' use experience quality and well-being. An ontology-based knowledge model has been developed to capture the fragmented knowledge of building use satisfaction assessment in the POE domain, with the benchmarking evaluation rules encoded in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to enable automatic rule-based rating and reasoning. This ontology model also enables the effective OSA-related knowledge retrieving and sharing, and promotes its implementation in the POE domain.

However, a conflicting criterion exists between energy conservation and thermal comfort improvement when making optimal design solutions for building retrofit. This study presents a simulation-based energy-comfort optimization model to facilitate evaluating various design alternatives and balancing multiple objectives in building green retrofit. A building simulation model is first established to measure energy consumption and comfort level. Then, a multi-objective optimization method (response surface method) is employed to identify critical building parameters and generates a set of alternative plans for building retrofit based on green building standards. After that, optimal design solutions with trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy demand are obtained. A school building in Wuhan city of China is chosen as a case to validate the developed model, and ten building parameters pertaining to energy demand and environmental comfort are considered in the optimization process. The results show that four parameters are significantly sensitive to energy efficiency and thermal comfort, including insulation thickness of the external wall, the heat transmission coefficient of the roof, solar heat gain coefficient of the external window, and window to wall ratio. The optimal combination of four parameters approximately produces 4 % of energy savings, as well as an improving level of environmental comfort.

This study presents a computational tool that automates the generation of optimal building designs in respect of their Life Cycle Carbon Footprint (LCCF) and Life Cycle Costs (LCC). This is achieved by an integration of three computational concepts: (a) A designated space-allocation generative-design application, (b) Using building geometry as a parameter in NSGA-II optimization and (c) Life Cycle performance (embodied carbon and operational carbon, through the use of thermal simulations for LCCF and LCC calculation). Examining the generation of a two-storey terrace house building, located in London, UK, the study shows that a set of building parameters combinations that resulted with a pareto front of near-optimal buildings, in terms of LCCF and LCC, could be identified by using the tool. The study shows that 80% of the optimal building’s LCCF are related to the building operational stage (σ = 2), while 77% of the building’s LCC is related to the initial capital investment (σ = 2). Analysis further suggests that space heating is the largest contributor to the building’s emissions, while it has a relatively low impact on costs. Examining the optimal building in terms compliance requirements (the building with the best operational performance), the study demonstrated how this building performs poorly in terms of Life Cycle performance.

The advent of Osterberg Cell (O-Cell) testing made it possible to fully test high-capacity barrettes. In this paper, the design of barrette foundations are compared to piles, with settlement predictions using geophysics data compared to O-Cell observations.

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is proposed as a prime example of innovative building products, revolutionising the use of timber in multi-storey construction. Therefore, an understanding of the synergy between structural engineering design solutions and climate impact of CLT is essential. In this study, the carbon footprint of a CLT multi-storey building is analysed in a life cycle perspective and strategies to optimise this are explored through a synergy approach, which integrates knowledge from optimised CLT utilisation, connections in CLT assemblies, risk management in building service-life and life cycle analysis. The study is based on emerging results in a multi-disciplinary research project to improve the competitiveness of CLT-based building systems through optimised structural engineering design and reduced climate impact. The impacts associated with material production, construction, service-life and end-of-life stages are analysed using a process-based life cycle analysis approach. The consequences of CLT panels and connection configurations are explored in the production and construction stages, the implications of plausible replacement scenarios are analysed during the service-life stage, and in the end-of-life stage the impacts of connection configuration for post-use material recovery and carbon footprint are analysed. The analyses show that a reduction of up to 43% in the life cycle carbon footprint can be achieved when employing the synergy approach.

While notable advances have emerged for using BIM-based configurators to improve building design and project execution, there is a need expand such configurators to look at how buildings can be adapted and re-configured across their lifecycle. This paper develops and demonstrates an innovative feature modeling approach for configuring and adapting modular buildings. This study uses BIM for structuring intricate feature relationships of specific design aspects in terms of product circularity. The design aspects considered are structural design, dimensional variation control, and disassembly planning design. Feature parameter maps, which are a general constraint relation representation, are implemented to describe the data models since they are an efficient way to visualize feature elements and interdependencies, to avoid the creation of redundant information, and to improve data structure consistency. The application of the proposed methodology is validated with a functional demonstration of a conceptual design and optimization for a single module that is meant to be part of a modular construction project. The product model was synthesized in a parametric BIM environment for iterative configuration, analysis of results, and final optimization of the single module assembly. The demonstration case study shows that BIM can be adapted to assist on modeling specific design aspects for modular buildings and to create design alternatives. Also, the method shows a considerable benefit that the designer can produce diverse accurate design alternatives within a reduced amount of time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:55","2024-02-20 10:36:33","","","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2021.101514","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Structural design; Conceptual design; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Design alternatives; Ecodesign; Building Information Modelling; Product design; Modeling languages; Design approaches; Modular construction; Modular buildings; 'current; Circular economy; Configurator; Feature modeling; Feature models; Modular building; Single modules; Visual languages; Visual programming languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in tropical and subtropical regions, the dense urban morphology usually results in not only an increase in temperature, but also the excessive building energy consumption. This paper presents a study on the influence of urban design parameters, such as street aspect ratios and orientations, on building cooling demands in the central area of cities. In this study, building energy simulations were conducted based on various urban scenarios characterized by different canyon geometries by using HTB2 and the Virvil plugin. The weather data needed in the energy simulation were obtained from the ENVI-met calculations. The energy results presented in this study suggest that the potential energy savings could be achieved through the optimization of urban design. Some basic principles are suggested for the street design in subtropical areas with similar climate conditions as Nanjing city. Furthermore, the cooling demands based on the localized and recorded weather data were both investigated and compared. An approximately 20% difference in cooling demand could be caused by the disparities between these two sets of weather data. The comparative analysis of two sets of energy results highlights the importance of implementing localized weather data in building energy simulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:55","2024-02-20 10:35:14","","","","","142","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.110862","Architectural design; Structural design; Geometry; Aspect ratio; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Building energy simulations; Tropics; Urban planning; Atmospheric temperature; Meteorology; Cooling; Weather data; Building energy simulation; Potential energy; Morphology; Aspect ratios; Canyon geometry; Cooling demand; Street geometries; Urban design; Urban heat island; Urban morphology; Aspect-ratio; Building cooling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this goal, careful assessment of risk from future hazards is required. In practice, the risk to building structures is regulated by structural design codes through target reliability levels, which are reflected in many code factors, including partial safety factors, load combination factors, and modification factors. Optimizing the target reliability levels often requires running a large number of nonlinear dynamic analyses of complex finite element models, which imposes a significant burden on the computational resources. Computation time can be reduced considerably by employing surrogate models that can efficiently approximate the relation between input design and hazard intensity variables with building response output. This paper explores the different surrogate models, namely, support vector machines, kriging, and neural networks, for structural response prediction of a building class so that they can be used in the target reliability index optimization of a building class (a group of buildings with the same load-carrying characteristics). The uniqueness of this study is in developing a single surrogate model for a group of buildings instead of a single building design. The investigation on the performance of the surrogate models in structural response prediction is conducted for mid-rise office building class by comparing the computation time, accuracy, and robustness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:55","2024-03-25 13:35:52","","","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\KJLN2PIA\Gudipati and Cha - 2021 - Surrogate modeling for structural response predict.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.102041","Architectural design; Reliability; Structural design; Hazards; Seismic design; Office buildings; Forecasting; Building class; Computational resources; Load combination factors; Load-carrying characteristics; Modification factors; Partial safety factor; Risk assessment; Safety factor; Seismic response estimation; Steel moment-resisting frame; Structural design codes; Structural response prediction; Support vector machines; Surrogate model; Target reliability index; Target reliability index optimization; Seismic response; Structural frames; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Others (target reliability index)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to design a hotel building for hot and dry climate conditions and perform its energy performance analysis using energy simulation tools. The model of the hotel building was constructed by a graphical tool OpenStudio and EnergyPlus following the ASHRAE Standard 90.1. To reduce the energy demand of the hotel, parametric analysis was conducted and building envelope parameters such as the thickness of insulation layer in the exterior wall and the roof, thermal conductivity of insulation layer, rate of infiltration, U-factor of windows, and thermal resistance of air gap in the interior walls (R-value), window-to-wall ratio, and orientation of the building were tested and the impact on the energy use of the building was analyzed. It was found that most of the design assumptions based on the ASHRAE standard were already optimal for the considered locality, however, were still optimized further to reach the highest efficiency level. Apart from this, three sustainable technologies—thermochromic windows, phase change materials, and solar panels—were incorporated into the building and their energy consumption reduction potential was estimated by energy simulations. Cumulatively, these sustainable technologies were able to reduce the total energy use from 2417 GJ to 1593 GJ (i.e., by 824 GJ or 34%). Calculation of payback period and return on investments showed that thermochromic windows and solar panels have relatively short payback periods and high return on investments, whereas PCM was found to be economically nonviable. The findings of this study are deemed to be useful for designing a sustainable and energy-efficient hotel building in a sub-tropical climate. However, the overall design and energy performance analysis algorithm could be used for various buildings with varying climate conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

This introduces uncertainty as the surrogate is only an approximation of the original model. Bayesian methods can quantify that uncertainty, and deep learning models exist that follow the Bayesian paradigm. These models, namely Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian process models, enable us to give predictions together with an estimate of the model's uncertainty. As a result we can derive uncertainty-aware surrogate models that can automatically suspect unseen design samples to cause large emulation errors. For these samples the high-fidelity model can be queried instead. This outlines how the Bayesian paradigm allows us to hybridize fast, but approximate, and slow, but accurate models. In this paper, we train two types of Bayesian models, dropout neural networks and stochastic variational Gaussian Process models, to emulate a complex high dimensional building energy performance simulation problem. The surrogate model processes 35 building design parameters (inputs) to estimate 12 annual building energy performance metrics (outputs). We benchmark both approaches, prove their accuracy to be competitive, and show that errors can be reduced by up to 30% when the 10% of samples with the highest uncertainty are transferred to the high-fidelity model. © 2020 The Author(s)","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:56","2024-02-20 10:42:41","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 20</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100039","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Bayesian networks; Building performance simulations; Stochastic models; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty analysis; Surrogate modelling; Meta model; Uncertainty; Gaussian Processes; Bayesian; Gaussian distribution; Bayesian deep learning; Bayesian neural network; Bayesian neural networks; Bayesian paradigm; building performance simulation; Gaussian noise (electronic); Gaussian Process; Gaussian process models; metamodel; uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These applications have shown successful response reduction performance for tall buildings. The important dynamic responses of building structures with the IIS are the peak intermediate isolator drift (IID), and the peak inter-story drift (ISD). The semi-active intermediate isolation system (SAIIS) was developed to more effectively reduce these seismic responses. In previous study, the authors showed that the SAIIS using magnetorheological dampers successfully reduced both the IID and the ISD. However, the optimal design of the SAIIS only was conducted, without considering the building structure. If both the SAIIS and the building structure properties are considered in the optimal design procedure, more effective optimal design for both the SAIIS and the building structure can be achieved. In this research, a simultaneous multi-objective optimization (MOO) method of the SAIIS and the building structure is proposed to achieve this.

Taking advantage of the classic linear mode shape assumption of the HFFB technique, this paper also presents an alternative routine that transforms all different types of constraints into a uniform frequency constraint, which significantly reduces the computational intensity while still offers acceptable accuracy of optimization results. Moreover, the sensitivity of the optimization results to the adopted basic wind pressure value is discussed. The total material cost of the optimized structure increases exponentially with the increase of the basic wind pressure, indicating that the structural costs of supertall buildings are quite sensitive to the adopted basic wind pressure for structural design and its value should be precisely determined by the wind climate analysis of the construction site. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:56","2024-03-26 10:52:16","","","","","248","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\KJTJY4G8\Xu et al. - 2021 - Wind-resistant structural optimization of supertal.pdf","","architectural design; multistorey building; Cost benefit analysis; HFFB; High frequency force balances; Mathematical transformations; Optimal design methods; Optimisations; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Tall buildings; Wind stress; Wind tunnel test; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Super tall buildings; Tall building; vibration; Vibration analysis; Vibrations analysis; Wind induced vibrations; Wind pressures; wind stress; wind tunnel; Wind tunnel experiment; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Composite (CFST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While Life Cycle Assessment and many environmental approaches as well as low-carbon materials are key areas of sustainable designs, optimisation methods have not been fully developed and integrated in the design process to enhance a building's sustainability. Although there are studies attempting to mitigate buildings' carbon footprints, most of them examine the major components (slab and column systems) separately, making it hard for structural engineers to apply their findings in a real project. This paper intends to address this limitation by introducing an innovative design methodology for the carbon optimisation of reinforced concrete buildings. A detailed formulation of a flat plate building's optimisation is presented, and an advanced Branch-and-Reduce deterministic algorithm is adopted to solve for minimum CO2 emissions. Compared to genetic algorithm, the proposed approach achieves a further 31% reduction in the building's embodied emissions. In this research, multiple case studies are optimised and analysed with respect to varying slab spans and numbers of stories. Overall, the optimisation algorithm performs more efficiently in buildings that are subjected to greater compressive loads, and the optimal designs tend to reduce the slab-to-column area ratio to obtain the best sustainable outcomes. Compared to the conventional designs, the optimised ones achieve 5.3–17.7% reduction in the total carbon emissions. From a correlation analysis, the column concrete strength, column size, and building's height are found to be the most significant design variables. Although the structural weight is closely related to the total embodied carbon in optimised buildings, solutions with greater material savings are not necessarily more environmentally superior. It is the balancing act between the design constraints, ratio of concrete and reinforcement consumption, and ratio of concrete and steel carbon coefficients that determines the most eco-friendly design option. Given a complex relation between design variables, a thorough optimisation problem and methodology as presented in this paper are highly effective and recommended in sustainable designs of concrete buildings. The obtained findings from the numerical applications could effectively guide structural designers towards sustainable design solutions that have the best environmental performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:56","2024-02-20 10:39:50","","","","","320","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128780","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Optimisations; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Emission control; Optimisation; Ecodesign; Reinforced concrete; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Plates (structural components); % reductions; Carbon footprint; Design variables; Deterministic algorithms; Environmental management; Flat plate; Flat plate building; Global environmental impacts; Low carbon; Reinforced concrete structure; Reinforced concrete structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For better use of the combined heating terminal, more in-depth simulation and optimization research are carried out. Firstly, based on the experimental research, an analysis model of heat dissipation performance of the combined heating terminal with alternating operation is established, and the accuracy of the model is verified by the experimental data. Secondly, by setting up the meteorological data of typical building and typical day, the heat storage/release performance of the combined heating terminal and its influence on thermal environment in the alternating operation process are simulated and analyzed. The design parameters, operation parameters and strategies are explored based on the temperature response time and the satisfaction degree of differentiated thermal demands. The influence characteristics of each parameter of the combined heating terminal on the thermal environment are obtained. Finally, the energy consumption under two different working conditions of the combined heating terminal temporal-spatial partitioned and the traditional comprehensive heating mode is compared and discussed.

The differences, characteristics, and applicable scales are compared between different umbrella structure types in terms of their morphological characteristics. The changes in structural form efficiency under material innovations and optimized structural morphologies are explained. The orders of different structure types and morphological characteristics under different parameters are given. Steel umbrella and reinforced concrete umbrella structures have more prominent unit sizes, while light steel umbrella structure and membrane umbrella structure are more prominent in terms of form efficiency. In addition to the better performance of the tubular type in terms of height (H), the segmented ribbed columnar type features the most prominent coverage area (S1) and structure form efficiency (α, β, and η). The correlation between different variables related to structural morphology is also revealed. By combining the limit value and range of related variables, and by establishing a function model of the relationships between structural form efficiency and size, this work provides a workable reference for umbrella structure unit design. Among them, H-ηhigh, S1-ηhigh, and S2-ηhigh explain the change trend of ηhigh with increases in H, S1, and S2. In the two sets of linear relations S2-Hhigh and S2–S1high, the approximate growth relationship between variables are given. If S2 increases by 1 m2, Hhigh can increase by 2.0 m, if S2 increases by 1 m2, S1high can increase by 83.6 m2.

The design of net Zero Energy Buildings promotes the energy transition from fossil fuels based technologies by coupling renewable systems as photovoltaic (PV) plants with heat pumps for heating and cooling. In this framework, the correct sizing of PV plants plays a central role in the perspective of the definition of self-consumption schemes. Considering the problems related to small-scale photovoltaic plants, the present paper proposes an analysis of different sizing strategies on the energy streams between the building and the electrical grid to reduce the bidirectional energy flows with the electrical grid. The design objective concern the minimization of both the energy exported and imported through an optimized size of the PV plant and the integration of electrochemical energy storage. The investigation is based on the experimental data under real operating conditions obtained from two different residential buildings, a conventional residential house, and a nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB). The paper aims to discuss the results of the monitoring activity and define criteria and guidelines for the design of this kind of systems based on real collected data.

However, data exchange between BIM and VR is a complex and time consuming process, which has limited VR applications in practice. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel method that enables an efficient interoperability of BIM and VR including geometry of each element along with required semantic data of the BIM model. In this method, geometry and semantic data are extracted from BIM models through an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file, which is then optimized to be efficiently imported and recreated into the VR environment. The backward communication is performed by converting XML file to IFC, which is then imported to the BIM application. A prototype was developed to implement the proposed methodology. A building case study was used to demonstrate the capability of the method including considerably short transfer time, high quality rendering and geo-semantic data exchange for design and construction. These capabilities promote VR applications in the AEC/FM industry as the required information for design and construction plan review including Architectural parameter (e.g., material, texture and dimensions), Engineering parameters (e.g., loads, R-Value), cost, schedule and clashes can be exchanged between BIM and VR in near real time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:57","2024-02-20 10:05:57","","","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 28</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Construction; Design and construction; Building Information Modelling; Office buildings; BIM; Cost engineering; Semantics; Virtual reality; Project management; Electronic data interchange; Architectural parameters; Construction planning; Engineering parameters; Extensible Mark-Up language (XML); Facility management; Geo-semantic; Hypertext systems; IFC; OpenBIM; Project planning; Textures; XML","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike previous studies, in this work, heat transfer considers temperatures of heat sources and receptors; production rates of plants are optimized to maximize GHG emissions reduction of the integrated operation. Results from case studies indicate if temperature levels are not considered, more than 33% of deemed heat transfer is infeasible. Operating the integrated plants at a steady daily production rate brings a significant reduction in GHG emissions for systems accessing the northeast U.S. grid. Further reduction of GHG emissions is accomplished by scheduling the production rate. Schedules with at most one daily production rate change have only 0.4% higher GHG emissions than the optimum, which has frequent production rate changes. When the standalone system and integrated system have the same annual total cost, the integrated system reduces GHG emissions by at least 18.8% and reduces electricity purchases by 66%. Therefore, the integrated operation can reduce GHG emissions of the system, where the maximum reduction is achieved by optimizing the design and operation of energy system equipment, considering the temperature of heating demands, and optimizing production rates of plants with constraints applied to changes of the rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:57","2024-02-20 10:05:57","","","","","305","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 5</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Emission control; Office buildings; Heat transfer; Housing; Energy systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Distributed energy system; Distributed energy systems; Energy integration of building and light industry; Energy integration of buildings and light industry; Energy-integration; Gas plants; GHG emissions reduction; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Integrated control; Integrated Operations; Optimal integration; Optimal integration of energy system; Optimal integration of energy systems; Production rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses are performed to calculate the mean wind velocity, while all CFD experiment samples are determined through the Box-Behnken design of experiment method. Based on 54 CFD experiments, the relationships between building design variables and the summer and winter mean wind velocities within a specified assessment area are learned using the response surface methodology. Finally, a genetic algorithm with the desirability function as the objective function is applied to identify near optimal design options under the robustness control (i.e., family error rate λ) for response surface models. The framework is applied to an infill development project to highlight its suitability in a real application.

In consequence, the embodied impact of buildings has become relatively more important. As the load-bearing structure is responsible for a large share of this embodied impact, it is important to design it in such a way that its environmental impact is as low as possible. Unfortunately, the best construction materials in terms of environmental impact are not necessarily the cheapest. Reducing the environmental impact of the design may therefore lead to a higher financial cost, which may exceed the available budget. In such cases, hybrid structures, consisting of two (or more) different materials, might offer a solution, as they allow the designer to finetune the trade-off between environmental impact and financial cost. In this paper, we present a method to determine the best design of hybrid steel/timber structures in terms of environmental impact within the limits of the available budget. The method is based on the solution of a multi-objective structural design optimization problem involving environmental life cycle assessment and life cycle costing. It is applied to two test cases: a statically determinate and a statically indeterminate truss structure. The structures are optimized for three different design scenarios and typical load cases. This results in a Pareto front in the environmental and financial life cycle cost spectrum, allowing the designer to select the most appropriate solution, given the available budget. The results show that, depending on the design conditions, hybrid steel/timber structures are in some cases Pareto-optimal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-02-20 10:05:58","2024-02-20 10:05:58","","","","","254","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Life cycle; Building materials; Costs; Economic and social effects; Budget control; Ecodesign; Multi-objective optimization; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; Environmental impact; Design optimization; Life cycle assessment; Pareto principle; Sustainable construction; Case-studies; Multi-objectives optimization; Energy performance of buildings; Timber structures; Financial costs; Impact costs; Life cycle costing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The created virtual model of the facility allows coordinating all industries during the entire life cycle of the building. The possibility to save the data related to the given facility in one place, namely in the BIM model, enables control and management of the AEC projects at every stage. During the design and implementation phase, BIM models facilitate the optimization of time, costs, and quality, and in the operational phase, they support effective management of the facility. The use of BIM for building energy modeling (BEM) is the next step of evolution in architecture and engineering design practice. The benefits of using the BIM approach are widely discussed in the literature; however, they may be hard to achieve if appropriate attention is not directed to minimizing the barriers to the implementation of this technology. Observing Europe, one can notice that western and northern countries successfully use BIM for their needs, while the countries of the Eastern Bloc, including Poland, introduce it at a slower pace. In the present paper, the authors conducted a cause-and-effect analysis of the identified barriers to the implementation of BIM technology in the construction process. For this purpose, the authors applied the Ishikawa diagram, which is a tool that helps to recognize the actual or potential causes of failure. The analysis conducted showed that one of the weakest links in the successful BIM implementation is people and, in particular, their lack of knowledge and reluctance to change. The authors indicated the need to introduce and strengthen preventive actions, mainly through education: training, courses, and studies focused on BIM technology. © 2021 by the authors.

The GDS platform aims to simplify the design and analysis process by embedding performance parameters into design elements in modules and employing near-real-time model for whole building performance simulation as well as by providing an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface to assist users without extensive knowledge on building physics. The platform consists of building modules as fundamental building blocks, performance predicting models, and a user interface for visualization and interactive design. In the platform, a whole building is composed of modules organized in a hierarchical structure, including spaces, enclosures, service systems, sustainable resource systems and sites. Both physics-based and data-driven models can be used to simulate the building performance and optimize building systems. A simplified physics-based model, the Resistance–Capacitance (RC) model, has been proposed as a generic simulation model for the flows of heat, air, moisture and pollutants, which is significantly faster than conventional simulation tools such as EnergyPlus, and hence more practical for use in real-time design interaction and optimization. A pilot case study is conducted to illustrate the modular-based design approach using a section of an office building. Compared to conventional building performance analysis tools, the GDS platform can provide fast and reliable feedback on performance prediction for early design. The modular approach makes it easier to modify the building design and evaluate the potentials and contributions of various green design features and technologies. © 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:58","2024-02-20 10:05:58","","241-268","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 8</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\NJ73ZRQH\Shen et al. - 2021 - Green Design Studio A modular-based approach for .pdf","","Architectural design; Structural design; Ecodesign; Office buildings; Building performance simulations; High performance buildings; Hierarchical systems; building simulation; energy efficiency; Studios; Hierarchical structures; building performance; Heat resistance; Building performance analysis; Computer aided software engineering; Fundamental building blocks; Generic simulation models; green building; high-performance building; Intuitive user interface; modular-based building design; Performance parameters; User interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the design process of a building, the use of a lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and validated on two design options. The application of the actual building project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second alternative by 4.6%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by 35.4%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4% within the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin, designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in its life cycle according to the proposed indices. © 2020","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:58","2024-02-20 10:05:58","","","","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 35</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\RBKAG9H4\Rad et al. - 2021 - BIM-based approach to conduct Life Cycle Cost Anal.pdf","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Conceptual design; Earthquakes; Life cycle; Life cycle costs (LCC); Cost reduction; Environmental impact; Building Information Modeling (BIM); Conceptual design stages; Cost estimating; Economic performance; Embodied environmental impact; Failure cost; Life cycle cost analysis; Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA); Repair and maintenance; Resilient buildings; Total life cycle costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced thermal comfort-based control strategies have been proposed for this purpose. However, such an approach could consume energy as the conventional one if the building is poorly designed. The aim of this study is to propose a method that integrates thermal comfort in the design of energy-efficient buildings. The use of sensitivity analysis and an optimization approach to identify the values of design parameters represent its core steps. The meta-modeling approach based on the design of experiments technique is adopted to perform the sensitivity analysis. Then, the obtained meta-models are used to optimize building design for the intended objectives. A case study is selected to test the proposed method. The results indicated that implementing the suggested strategy leads to about 20% of heating energy-savings compared to the base case while significantly enhancing occupant thermal comfort. Moreover, the results indicated that a reduction of about 22% of heating energy can be achieved compared to the comfort controlled case while it consumes 4% more if the comfort control is applied to the optimized design while maintaining consistent thermal comfort conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:05:58","2024-02-20 10:05:58","","","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Optimization; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Sensitivity analysis; Energy utilization; Optimization approach; Optimization method; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Design parameters; Thermal comfort; Energy efficient building; Energy savings; Design of experiments; Analysis of variance; Comfort conditions; Low-energy-consumption buildings; Meta-model approach; Thermal comfort-based controls","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose is to better understand the trade-offs between open and enclosed spaces and how opposing and complimentary design elements influence behavior and occupancy choices. Using the lens of space choice behaviors, we hypothesize that similar design challenges exists at both scales, and that analogous insights can be applied to both urban planning and building design. We analyze the focus areas, research drivers, locations, and methods applied in the reviewed studies, and find overlapping similarities within research at both scales, particularly in the methods applied. The drivers for research into buildings tend to be more about optimizing space allocation, whereas lifestyles and well-being are more common in urban studies.

It proposes to use an automatic prototype to perform the structural design, analysis and optimisation in a building information modelling (BIM)-based platform. This process starts with extracting the required information from the architectural model in Revit Autodesk, such as boundary conditions and designs different options of the structural models in Robot Autodesk. In this process, Dynamo for Revit is used to define the mathematical functions to use different variables and generate various structural models. The paper aims to expand the domain of automation in the BIM platform to reduce the iterative process in different areas such as conceptual structural design and collaboration between architects and structural engineers to reduce the time and cost at the early stages. Design/methodology/approach: The paper begins with an exploratory research by adopting a qualitative methodology and using open-ended questions to achieve more information about the phenomenon of automation and interoperability between structural engineers and architects and gain new insight into this area. Furthermore, correlation research is used by adopting quantitative and short questions to compare the proposed prototype with the traditional process of the structural design and optimisation and the interoperability between architects and engineers and consequently, validate the research. Findings: As an outcome of the research, a structural design optimisation (SDO) prototype was developed to semi-automate the structural design process of tall buildings at the early stages. Moreover, the proposed prototype can be used during the early stage of structural design in different areas such as residential buildings, bridges, truss, reinforced concrete detailing, etc. Moreover, comprehensive literature regarding using automation in structural design, optimisation process and interoperability between architects and engineers is conducted that provides a new insight to contribute to future research and development. Research limitations/implications: Due to the time limit, the paper results may lack in a comprehensive automatic structural design process. Therefore, the researchers are encouraged to expand the workability of the prototype for a comprehensive automatic design check such as automatic design for the minimum deflection, displacement of different types of buildings. Practical implications: The prototype includes implications for the development of different automatic designs. Originality/value: The focus of this paper is the optimisation of the structural design in the BIM platform by using automation. This combination is one of the novelties of this paper, and the existing literature has a very limited amount of information and similar work in this area, especially interoperability between architects and engineers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-02-20 10:05:58","2024-03-25 10:33:16","","149-169","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 10</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\LKFWDJVV\Hamidavi et al. - 2020 - OSD A framework for the early stage parametric op.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CI-11-2019-0126","Architectural design; Automation; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Iterative methods; Design/methodology/approach; Reinforced concrete; Building Information Modelling; Interoperability; Engineers; Structural optimization; Amount of information; Architectural modeling; Bridges; Functions; Integration; Machine design; Mathematical functions; Qualitative methodologies; Research and development; Residential building; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 5_Multistory (1,2 stories)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performance-based wind-resistant structural optimization can effectively reduce the material cost of supertall buildings in the premise of ensuring their structural safety and serviceability. For modern supertall buildings with complex structural systems, the formulation of its structural optimization problem is highly complicated. Moreover, the optimization problem itself is also nonlinear and extensive in scale. This study first addresses the optimization formulation of complex structure system which includes concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) frame members and shear wall members. These structural members are often used in supertall buildings but are seldom discussed in existing literature of structural optimization. Then, the interior point algorithm, which is propitious for large-scale nonlinear optimization, is used to seek the optimal design solution.

In contrast to regular buildings, NZEBs have interactive and complex energy systems that require synthetical evaluation of their complicated interplay with the grid. Many studies implemented various optimization approaches to improve the NZEBs energy system designed with a global optimal sizing solution. However, the optimal design is often infeasible due to the availability of proper equipment sizing on the markets. In addition, due to the uncertainty caused by different climate conditions, government feed-in-tariff subsidies, and availability of renewable systems, there could exist multiple distinctive design solutions for the same building. Therefore, this study intends to develop a heuristic multiple objectives algorithm based on the glowworm swarm mechanism to refine the optimization of the grid-interactive NZEB design. To validate the proposed method, a case study of the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building was examined and three design variables (area of the photo-voltage system, installation power of the wind turbine system, and capacity of the thermal energy storage system) were optimized. The results suggest that the optimized design can outperform the baseline design in terms of operating costs and grid energy consumption. In addition, multiple local optima design solutions that represent different design strategies can be identified using the proposed non-linear model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:05:59","2024-02-20 10:05:59","","","","","208","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 27</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Optimization approach; Heat storage; Availability; Operating costs; Zero energy buildings; Net-zero energy buildings; Complex energy systems; Glowworm swarm optimization; Glowworm swarm optimizations; Grid-interactive NZEBs; Heuristic optimization; Thermal energy storage systems; Wind turbine systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements. The proposed approach contributes to broadening the scope of building information modeling-enabled rule checking to any natural language-based design requirements.  © 2020 The Author(s).

The U.S. fire statistics reveal that, in 2017 alone, 1,319,500 fires caused 3400 deaths and 14,670 injuries, which resulted in a loss of $23 billion [1]. Effective evacuation planning in densely occupied buildings should be primarily put in place if both the number of injuries/fatalities and the level of property loss are to be minimized. However, it is not realistic, and is unethical to study human evacuation performance under a burning building. For this reason, computational tools tend to be the best approach for simulating fire growth as well as human response to fire hazards. This study aims to develop a BIM-based simulation framework that implements the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and agent-based modeling (ABM) for simulating fire growth and evacuation performance for different building layout scenarios. An experimental implementation is conducted to validate the proposed framework, which verified the benefits of (1) using BIM to offer a platform for conducting simulation design and visualizing the simulation results of (a) hazardous fire zones and (b) effective escape routes; (2) simulating fire growth using the FDS tool; (3) developing an agent-based model that accounts for the critical factors affecting evacuation performance; and (4) applying a statistical analysis for investigating the effects of influential parameters from the proposed model. As a result, the simulation outputs can be used to optimize the building design and to investigate the influential factors on human evacuation efficiency.

It has become a challenge to fulfil different measures of building envelope design optimisation through enhancement of energy conservation. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes an optimisation model for determining the optimum envelope design of a reference building in four climate regions. The optimisation model utilised a genetic algorithm, as an optimisation tool, and national standards to define the thermal insulation requirements of buildings for energy calculation. The building prototype was analysed to minimise the life-cycle cost (LCC), where building envelope elements-namely, windows, exterior walls, basement floor and ceilings-were included as energy efficiency measures. The results showed how each building element affects energy consumption in different climate regions. Exterior wall insulation was observed to have the maximum impact on the LCC of the whole building, which was followed by the window type selection. An optimally designed residential building was found to spend approximately 20-25% less energy than the limiting values expressed in the national standard.

Medium-rise office buildings were designed in accordance with U.S. building codes and standards. These buildings were designed with steel gravity frames and different lateral force resisting systems: (1) interior rigid core walls, and (2) perimeter moment resisting frames. Code-based prescriptive approaches were used to design the passive fire protection for the structural members of the steel buildings. The structural performance of these buildings, when subjected to realistic design-basis compartment fire scenarios (one-hour fire with cooling), was evaluated by conducting detailed nonlinear inelastic finite-element analysis of the complete three-dimensional (3D) building system. The analysis results indicated that steel gravity columns were the most vulnerable component, susceptible to inelastic buckling during the fire events. This could further precipitate the partial or overall collapse of the building during the fire event. This fundamental understanding of structural performance and vulnerabilities of the steel buildings (designed according to prescriptive approaches in codes) was leveraged to optimize the layout and distribution of passive fire protection in the steel buildings, leading to performance-based structural fire engineering. Detailed analysis results indicated that moving the fire protection from intermediate filler beams in the floor systems to the gravity columns improved structural performance, fire resistance, and collapse resistance of the steel buildings. This exemplifies the potential of performance-based fire protection engineering linked with structural engineering analyses to optimize design and economy. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:00","2024-02-20 10:40:31","","","","9","145","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 17</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\XKM8EDDI\Fischer et al. - 2019 - Performance-Based Structural Fire Engineering of S.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002370","Architectural design; Building codes; Codes (symbols); Structural analysis; Finite element method; Office buildings; Steel construction; Convergence of numerical methods; Finite-element; Fire; Fire extinguishers; Fire hazards; Fire protection; Fire protection engineering; Fire resistance; Fires; Lateral force resisting system; Moment resisting frames; Passive fire protection; Stability; Steel beams and girders; Steel Building Structures; Steel frame buildings; Steel-frame building; Structural fire engineering; Structural frames; Three-dimensional (3D) buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, glass facades have gained popularity due to their aesthetic appearance. However, Low performance facades often allow substantial heat exchange between the indoor and outdoor environment that increases building energy consumption and rapid change in indoor thermal environment near the glass façade. Thus, adequate design of building envelope, namely glass facades, is essential to ensure a trade-off between several aspects, such as aesthetic appearance of the building, occupants’ thermal and visual comfort and energy consumption. The main purpose of this study is to quantify the interactions and optimize building design, particularly glass facades, for thermal comfort based on the combined use of numerical simulations, Design of Experiments (DoE)technique and an optimization method. The proposed approach is applied to a real case study, characterized by two glass facades, after subjectively assessing thermal comfort using survey questionnaire. For the analysis, a previously developed and validated dynamic simulation model is used. The combined use of numerical simulations and DoE aims to determine the critical parameters affecting thermal comfort, and to develop meta-modeling relationships between design factors and response variables. The developed meta-models are then used to determine a set of optimal solutions by performing a simultaneous optimization of building design based on the desirability function approach. The results indicate that the optimized design improve thermal comfort conditions as well as energy-savings.

To minimize these adverse effects, the use of natural ventilation systems and hybrid ventilation systems in buildings have increased in recent years. This paper presents the development of a novel optimization model that provides the capability of optimizing education building design in order to maximize occupant satisfaction in the classrooms space in terms of perception of human bioeffluents/body odor while minimizing the construction cost. The multi-objective optimization model is developed in three main stages: (1) model formulation stage that identifies relevant design variables, objective functions and constraints; (2) model implementation stage that executes the optimization computations; and (3) model evaluation stage that analyses the performance of the developed model using an application example. The findings of this performance analysis illustrates the capability of the developed optimization model to generate a wide range of optimal trade-offs solutions, where each provides a unique and optimal trade-off between occupant satisfaction with human bioeffluents/body odor levels and its construction cost. This enables designers to generate and analyze these optimal trade-offs and accordingly identify an optimal set of design decisions that maximize satisfaction with human bioeffluents/body odor levels of occupants while complying with specified budget constraint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:00","2024-02-20 10:06:00","","","","","169","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 10</p>","","","Architectural design; architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; building; genetic algorithm; Economic and social effects; Budget control; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Natural ventilation; Ventilation; ventilation; Air quality; indoor air; Indoor air pollution; air quality; Education buildings; effluent; Human bioeffluents; Human body odor; Human body odors; Indoor air quality; odor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the literature, many methods have been proposed to achieve this goal by trying different control theorems, but all of these methods face some problems in correctly solving the problem. The Evolutionary Bat (EB) Algorithm is one of the recently introduced optimization methods and providing researchers to solve different types of optimization problems. This paper applies EB to the optimization of building control design. The optimized parameter is the input to the fuzzy controller, which gives the status response as an output, which in turn changes the state of the associated actuator. The novel control criterion for guarantee of the stability of the system is also derived for the demonstration in the analysis. This systematic and simplified controller design approach is the contribution for solving complex dynamic engineering system subjected to external disturbances. The experimental results show that the method achieves effective results in the design of closed-loop system. Therefore, by establishing the stability of the closed-loop system, the behavior of the closed-loop building system can be precisely predicted and stabilized. © 2019 Techno-Press, Ltd.

Results indicated that the water inlet temperature Tinlet and the indoor temperature Tin significantly affected the heat transfer rate of the TAW system. Secondly, a TAW system testbed was set up to conduct experiments for the validation of the simulation model developed in COMSOL.

A simple and practical system is proposed, featuring pre-cast textile reinforced concrete shells with a network of prestressed steel tension ties. A non-structural fill is included to provide a level top surface. Building on previous experimental and theoretical work, a complete design methodology is presented. This is then used to explore the structural behaviour of the proposed system, refine its design, and evaluate potential carbon savings. Compared to flat slabs of equivalent structural performance, significant embodied carbon reductions (53–58%) are demonstrated across spans of 6–18 m. Self-weight reductions of 43–53% are also achieved, which would save additional material in columns and foundations. The simplicity of the proposed structure, and conservatism of the design methodology, indicate that further savings could be made with future refinements.

This study assesses both the design and the construction of Concrete Deep Foundations (CDFs), which are widely used in construction, from an environmental perspective considering the following variables: (i) grade of prefabrication, i.e., fully cast in situ, partly prefabricated, and fully prefabricated; (ii) compressive strength of cast-in-situ concrete; and (iii) building design codes, i.e., current Spanish codes (EHE-08 and CTE), Eurocode with the Spanish annexes, and Eurocode with the United Kingdom annexes. In addition, the results of Dynamic Load Tests (DLTs) and the economic cost of several CDFs are evaluated. Geotechnical and structural designs of CDFs are carried out along with their life-cycle assessment. Some of the main findings include: (i) partially and fully prefabricated CDFs and conducting DLTs reduced the environmental impact in most categories (by up to 44% for global warming emissions) compared to the fully cast-in-situ CDFs, although they were 12–37% more expensive; (ii) changing the compressive strength of the concrete (in piles and cap) in fully cast-in-situ CDFs from 25 to 35 MPa reduced the environmental impact by up to 14–17% in all categories and economic costs by up to 12%; and, (iii) CDFs with bored piles resulted in the lowest environmental burden when designed with Eurocode and UK annexes (11–31% less impact), as did CDFs with driven piles designed with current Spanish codes (11–18% less impact).

Thus, increased demand for heating and cooling energy according to the season, as well as poor indoor thermal comfort, are inevitable. To overcome this problem, this study focused on the influence of passive design and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment performance on the energy performance of residential buildings, and explored potential energy-saving technology paths involving passive design and improved coefficient of performance through a multi-objective and multi-parameter optimisation technique. A large-scale questionnaire survey covering a typical city was first conducted to identify family lifestyle patterns regarding time spent at home, family type, air conditioner use habits, indoor thermal comfort, etc. Then, the actual heating and cooling energy consumption and information of model building were determined for this region. Subsequently, the design parameters of an individual building were simulated using Energyplus to investigate the cooling and heating energy consumption for a typical residential building with an air conditioner. The results indicated an improvement of approximately 30% in energy efficiency through optimisation of the external-wall insulation thickness and the external-window and shading performance, and through use of appropriate ventilation technology. Thus, a multi-objective and multi-parameter optimisation model was developed to achieve comprehensive optimisation of several design parameters. Experimental results showed that comprehensive optimisation could not only reduce cooling and heating energy consumption, but also improve the thermal comfort level achieved with a non-artificial cooling and heating source. Finally, three energy-saving technology paths were formulated to achieve a balance between indoor thermal comfort improvement and the target energy efficiency (20 kWh/(m2·a)).

Various initiatives are being implemented to reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage.

The research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific robustness of LCA metrics.

This paper aims to automate manufacturing processes by optimising the utilisation of BIM digital objects (BDO) via the development of a conceptual model. Concomitant objectives seek to reduce design errors; eliminate unnecessary costs; automate the generation of quantity bills; and maximise productivity performance. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive approach was adopted through a post positivist epistemological lens set within the context of a case study of a small- and medium-sized enterprise. From an operational perspective, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed via a novel four-phase waterfall design, namely, literature diagnosis; recording contemporary practice; mapping manufacturing workflow and procedures; and evaluation and proof of concept development. Findings: The work illustrates that BDO enhances manufacturing workflow, reduces product manufacturing lead time and augments quality assurance throughout the whole life cycle of a manufactured product. The conceptual model developed provides a pragmatic and comprehensive solution to automate construction manufacturing procedures and to improve the facilitation of information exchanged between all stakeholders involved. Originality/value: This study presents the first comprehensive case study of BDO application within a manufacturing context. Future research is however, needed to test and validate the conceptual model presented in practice. In doing so, the model can be further refined using practitioner input and real-life manufacturing processes and procedures. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:01","2024-02-20 10:06:01","","960-984","","5","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\ZK8X9EFH\Al-Saeed et al. - 2019 - A conceptual framework for utilising BIM digital o.pdf","","Architectural design; Structural design; Design/methodology/approach; Life cycle; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; BIM; Supply chains; Information management; Quality assurance; BIM objects; Building information modelling (BIM); Conceptual framework; Conceptual frameworks; Construction supply chain; Manufacturing procedure; Productivity performance; Small and medium sized enterprise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The related advantages are numerous and not only limited to a realtime interaction among the involved subjects, that can actually operate in an optimized 3D shared environment. Owing to the sharing information philosophy and to the features of various ""smart objects"" combined in the project, this innovation reduces potential errors and increases the effectiveness of the design solution in terms of both functionality and cost. Despite these advantages, the highway alignment design problem remains very complicated and not easy to solve without appropriate supporting tools. In recent years, several efforts have been spent in defining highway optimization procedures for helping designers in the selection of an optimal solution in compliance with numerous different constraints. Introducing these procedures in a BIM environment may represent a crucial step in the improvement of the highway design procedures, exploiting the full representation and modelling potential of the approach. In this paper, the authors present the advantages of a 3D highway alignment optimization algorithm, based on the Particle Swarm Optimization method, and its possible implementation in a BIM platform.

Little, if any, research has been conducted regarding the design and construction of a floor system that successfully accounts for eco-friendliness. To remedy this, an optimal sustainable design model for composite beams (OSDMCB) has been developed. The proposed OSDMCB was used to analyse the relationship between CO2 emissions and costs required for the construction of concrete slabs supported by steel beams composed of four different materials: concrete, steel frame, rebar, and a shear connector. To verify the performance of the OSDMCB, it was applied to the design and construction of composite beams in a 30-story office building.

Therefore, a well-known robust algorithm is used as an optimization technique of BAPV system and considers technoeconomic assessment on campus. This paper presents a combination of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with fuzzy theory (fuzzy AHP) for selecting a suitable and optimal design of BAPV system on academic campus. The BAPV system design is based on roof area and load profile at the project site. Five BAPV systems have been designed using five different types of PV. The design was comprehensively assessed by experts through a questionnaire with pairwise comparison model. Fuzzy AHP used to consider the qualitative and quantitative assessments that can affect the selection process. The comprehensive assessment in criteria consists of sizing systems, technical, economic, and environmental perspectives as criteria. The perspective is divided into 13 subcriteria. The results show degree of importance from the criteria-based fuzzy AHP as follows: technical > economic > environment > sizing system. Based on the assessment of criteria and subcriteria, design with monocrystalline is most suitable and polycrystalline as the least suitable design for BAPV system connected to grid and battery energy storage system in case study.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate how building envelope design parameters influence the energy performance of cellular mixed-mode office buildings, in order to identify key design variables. The analysis presents a comparison among literature research studies and typical construction practices from a sample of buildings located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. According to a base case model, established based on the real buildings sample, three sensitivity analysis techniques were performed to obtain relative parameter sensitivity to thermal loads: OFAT, Morris and Monte Carlo. Results showed the importance of the window opening effective area and the reduced impact of the window-to-wall ratio on the energy performance of mixed-mode office buildings. By applying a multivariate regression model, it showed significant in predicting 78.1% of the variance in annual thermal loads. The accurate determination of annual thermal loads into mixed-mode office buildings can be used to optimize the envelope characteristics based on a combination of input data and the building geometry.

Since the traditional inventory analysis method is more widely applied in the mature construction drawing design stage or with a detailed bill of quantities, developing a method suitable to provide design feedback during the schematic design stage is urgently needed. The key issues of the method that need to be solved are the lack of design information and the difficulty in obtaining quantities. To address the limitations, this paper proposes a BIM-based calculation method that takes the “building element” (BE) as the basic unit, and the accuracy is verified by a frame-structure case study. For this method, it is imperative to create carbon emission factors (CEFs) of the BEs as the basis of calculation combined with the quantities extracted from the model schedules by encoding, which can significantly contribute to the calculation. The results show that this method has good accuracy and high efficiency and can identify potential hotspots of ECEs, which conforms to design process and habits and provides design feedback function for carbon emission reduction (CER). At the schematic design stage, the application of this method can quantitatively evaluate the ECEs and optimize the design from the BE level so that the concept of low carbon design can be truly put into practice and the energy savings and emission reductions of buildings can be controlled as early as possible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:02","2024-02-20 10:28:21","","","","","185","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 38</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107306","Architectural design; Carbon; design method; optimization; Structural design; building; Construction drawings; carbon emission; Emission control; Schematic design; Design information; Design optimization; Energy conservation; energy use; Basis of calculation; Building components; Building elements; Building information model (BIM); Calculation methods; Carbon emission factors; Carbon emission reductions; Embodied carbon emissions; Emission reduction; Feedback; Low-carbon designs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An unmissable opportunity exists to tackle climate change, global warming, and resource scarcity by rethinking how we approach building design. Structural materials often dominate the total mass of a building; therefore, a significant potential for material efficiency and GHG emissions mitigation is to be found in efficient structural design and use of structural materials. To this end, environmental impact assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are increasingly used. However, they risk failing to deliver the expected benefits due to the high number of parameters and uncertainty factors that characterise impacts of buildings along their lifespans. Additionally, effort and cost required for a reliable assessment seem to be major barriers to a more widespread adoption of LCA. More rapid progress towards reducing building impacts seems therefore possible by combining established environmental impact assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning and neural networks. This short communication will briefly present previous attempts to employ such techniques in civil and structural engineering. It will present likely outcomes of machine learning and neural network applications in the field of structural engineering and – most importantly – it calls for data from professionals across the globe to form a fundamental basis which will enable quicker transition to a more sustainable built environment. © 2018","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:02","2024-02-20 10:38:31","","1-4","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 37</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\HX7ENCW4\D'Amico et al. - 2019 - Machine Learning for Sustainable Structures A Cal.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2018.11.013","Architectural design; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Structural design; Life cycle; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ecodesign; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Materials; Neural-networks; Carbon footprint; Structural; Global warming; Environmental impact assessments; Energy demands; Greenhouse gas emissions; Learning network; Life cycle assessment LCA; Life cycle assessment life cycle assessment; Sustainable; Sustainable structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the decision process relies often on one criterion only, such as costs or energy savings. We propose a multi-criteria approach based on multi-attribute utility theory to assess alternative energy efficiency measures, explicitly considering both environmental and economic criteria. We apply it to the design of a new residential building in Milan (Italy), with the aim to maximize CO2 emission savings related to electricity and gas consumption, and to minimize embodied energy and investment costs. After modelling the building prototype, alternative energy efficiency measures are assessed and ranked according to the selected criteria. The building optimized through the implementation of the best performing measures showed an overall 90% reduction in operational primary energy compared to the baseline building. The inclusion of the embodied energy altered the energy performance calculations resulting in 55–67% reduction in total energy over a 10-year period, and 77–82% over a 30-year period. Results point to the importance of a comprehensive implementation of measures, such as thermal improvements, high efficiency equipment, appliances, and renewable energy generation. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of this framework to support the decision process from a multi-criteria perspective, proposing a flexible method that can be adapted to other building types, environmental conditions, materials and technologies. It also highlights the importance of considering both environmental and economic criteria when designing a new building. It stresses how the embodied energy should be a criterion for technology selection, as current strategies to reduce operational energy often increase the amount of energy embodied into buildings with environmental consequences. © 2019 The Authors","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:02","2024-02-20 10:06:02","","","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 45</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\3QF4RF88\D'Agostino et al. - 2019 - Environmental and economic implications of energy .pdf","","Architectural design; Structural design; Carbon dioxide; CO2 emissions; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Decision theory; Embodied energy; Investments; Forestry; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency measures; Environmental technology; Building modelling; Building modelling and simulation; CO2 emission savings; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT); Multi-criteria decision making; Multiattribute utility theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to clearly represent the physical characteristics of the façade structural components, a large number of section views need to be produced, which is very time-consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, automatic generation of fabrication drawings for building façade components (such as mullions and transoms) is of paramount importance. In this paper, attempts have been made to develop an efficient framework in order to automatically generate fabrication drawings for building façade structural components, including mullions and transoms. To represent the complex physical characteristics (such as holes and notches) on mullions and transoms using minimum number of drawing views, a computational algorithm based on graph theory is developed to eliminate duplicated section views. Another methodology regarding the generation of breaks for top views is also proposed to further improve the quality of drawing layouts. The obtained drawing views are then automatically arranged using a developed approach. In addition, primary dimensions of the drawing views focusing on the physical features are also generated. Furthermore, in order to maintain the consistency of drawing formats across multiple drawings, a methodology is proposed to determine the scaling factors of the drawings by using clustering technique.

However, thermal comfort and energy-savings in such buildings are still questionable. Advanced comfort-based control strategies have been proposed in order to fulfill a tradeoff between energy-saving and occupants’ thermal comfort. Yet, they could consume energy as the conventional control approach if the building is poorly designed. Thus, an adequate design of building envelope, namely glass facades, is essential to achieve the desired trade-off. The objective of this study is to understand and formulate the relationship between the mean radiant temperature (MRT) and glass facades design parameters in a comfort-controlled space in order to optimize building design for a trade-off between energy savings and thermal comfort. The combined use of numerical simulations, the design of experiments (DoE) technique and an optimization approach is adopted. For the investigations, a previously developed and validated dynamic simulation model is used. The combined use of numerical simulation and DoE aims to identify the significant parameters affecting the MRT, as well as to develop a metamodeling relationship between the considered design factors and MRT. Lastly, the developed meta-models are validated and used to determine a set of optimal solutions using the desirability function approach. The results indicate that the optimized design case allowed about 26% reduction of heating energy consumption compared to the base case design.

However, at the early stage, BPS is often ignored, due to uncertainty, lack of details, and computational time. This article studies probabilistic and deterministic approaches to treat uncertainty; detailed and simplified zoning for creating zones; and dynamic simulation and machine learning for making energy predictions. A state-of-the-art approach, such as dynamic simulation, provide a reliable estimate of energy demand, but computationally expensive. Reducing computational time requires the use of an alternative approach, such as a machine learning (ML) model. However, an alternative approach will cause a prediction gap, and its effect on comparing options needs to be investigated. A plugin for Building information modelling (BIM) modelling tool has been developed to perform BPS using various approaches. These approaches have been tested for an office building with five design options. A method using the probabilistic approach to treat uncertainty, detailed zoning to create zones, and EnergyPlus to predict energy is treated as the reference method. The deterministic or ML approach has a small prediction gap, and the comparison results are similar to the reference method. The simplified model approach has a large prediction gap and only makes only 40% comparison results are similar to the reference method. These findings are useful to develop a BIM integrated tool to compare options at the early design stage and ascertain which approach should be adopted in a time-constraint situation. © 2020","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:03","2024-02-20 10:06:03","","","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 26</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Building Information Modelling; Energy simulation; Office buildings; Forecasting; Machine learning; Building performance simulations; Intelligent buildings; Energy efficient building; Early design stages; Turing machines; Probabilistic approaches; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Deterministic approach; Prediction gap; Probabilistic; State-of-the-art approach; Zoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is found that the optimal layouts identified differ from those obtained when bracing is sought for a pre-existing frame, already designed to resist gravity loads. A significant finding is that a parameter related to the difference in vertical and lateral loads to be applied in the applicable load cases is a key factor determining the optimal layout of frame members.

The first method, the design response grammar, uses design rules—configurable by parameters—to develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the structural system under development. The second method, design via optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization) and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation, which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density distribution of each individual structural component, which can be regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case study, the study shows that—after optimization—the fronts remain the same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the generalization that is established in the first case study by using the found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the computational cost.

Meanwhile, finding the appropriate BIM component in the huge library has become a challenge. Besides the methods of case-based reasoning (CBR) or multi-attribute decision model (MADM), the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) method of a recommendation system can be an efficient alternative. However, the user behavior patterns (i.e., the rating matrices) are changing with time to influence the recommendation precision. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the dynamic recommendation ability for BIM components by proposing a hybrid probabilistic matrix factorization method (PMF-GMn). The latent user preference matrix and the latent BIM component feature matrix can be generated by the PMF method from the rating matrix. Then, the predicted latent matrices can be obtained by the optimized grey model. Finally, the predicted latent matrices are further combined into the predicted rating matrix to recommend the appropriate BIM components. An illustrative example of the prefabricated building design is used to demonstrate the feasibility. This experiment is implemented by inviting twenty users to use the proposed SharePBIM platform for five months. The statistical results indicated that PMF-GMn can provide better performance than PMF in both two criteria of RMSE and Recall@k. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:04","2024-02-20 10:06:04","","","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 15</p>","","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Building information modeling; Structural design; Information theory; Prefabricated construction; Behavioral research; Prefabricated building; Case based reasoning; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Dynamic recommendations; Factorization; Grey model; Grey Model; Matrix algebra; Multi-attribute decisions; Probabilistic matrix factorization; Probabilistic matrix factorizations; Recommendation precision; Recommendation system; Recommender systems; User behavior patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is clearly defined, with validity for all climates of the world. Under cold climate conditions, the design typically focuses on minimising heat losses and optimising solar gains. In milder climates, moderate insulation, including improved window qualities, is sufficient, but on the other hand, the building performance during summer requires more careful consideration. For hotter climates, the insulation requirements increase again, and solar loads through windows, walls and roofs must be limited. In hot and humid climates, humidity loads are also minimised or reduced. In practical implementation, every Passive House has its own, specific boundary conditions which lead to different constructions and technical solutions to fulfil the stringent requirements of the Passive House standard. The paper briefly introduces Passive House design principles and criteria. Then, nine examples for passive houses in climates of Canada, the USA, Germany, China, Greece, Spain, Taiwan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates illustrate the bandwidth of possible solutions.

To analyze how CO2 emissions and amount of building materials in the floor system are affected by design parameters that can be considered in design and construction stages, a sustainable design model that minimizes CO2 emissions and construction costs of the flat plate floor system is developed.

However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-ε turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index CIOIv (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, CIOIv,F1 is used to represent CIOIv on the ground level. Data-driven CIOIv,F1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support. Compared with multivariate linear regression model, the Gradient Boosting non-linear model displays much higher prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error = 0.16 with R2 = 0.8). In early design stage, designers and engineers can skip the computational expensive CFD simulations and use this data-drive model to quickly check the building natural ventilation potentials of different design options in an urban environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:04","2024-02-20 10:34:29","","","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 53</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106394","Architectural design; Building codes; Structural design; Wind tunnels; design; machine learning; Learning systems; Machine learning; numerical model; Regression analysis; Wind; computer simulation; Ventilation; Ventilation codes; airflow; ventilation; Urban planning; Air; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; Digital storage; Early designs; CFD simulations; building code; Coupled CFD simulation; Data-driven model; Deterioration; Early design support; flow velocity; High-density cities; High-density city; urban area; Urban ventilation; wind field; Wind speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The architectural design has great potential to solve this problem because the building envelope exerts influence on the overall system performance, but this is a task that involves many objectives and constraints. In the last two decades, optimization studies applied to energy efficiency of buildings have helped specialists to choose the best design options. However, there is still a lack of optimization approaches applied to the design stage, which is the most influential stage for building energy efficiency over its entire life cycle. Therefore, this article presents a multi-objective optimization model to assist designers in the schematic building design, by means of the Pareto archived evolutionary strategies (PAES) algorithm with the EnergyPlus simulator coupled to evaluate the solutions. The search process is executed by a binary array where the array components evolve over the generations, together with the other building components. The methodology aims to find optimal solutions (OSs) with the lowest constructive cost associated with greater energy efficiency. In the case study, it was possible to simulate the process of using the optimization model and analyze the results in relation to: a standard building; energy consumption classification levels; passive design guidelines; usability and accuracy, proving that the tool serves as support in building design.

This is coupled with population growth and improved living standards that encourages the reliance on mechanical acclimatization. Lighting energy alone is responsible for a large portion of total energy consumption in office buildings; and the demand for artificial light is expected to grow in the next years. One of sustainable approaches to enhance energy-efficiency is to incorporate daylighting strategies, which entail the controlled use of daylight inside buildings. Daylight simulation is an active area of research that offers accurate estimations, yet requires a complex set of inputs. Even with today's computers, simulations are computationally expensive and time-consuming, hindering to acquire accelerated preliminary approximations in acceptable timeframes, especially for the iterative design alternatives. Alternatively, predictive models that build on machine learning algorithms have granted much interest from the building design community due to their ability to handle such complex non-linear problems, acting as proxies to heavy simulations. This research presents a review on the growing directions that exploit machine learning to rapidly predict daylighting performance inside buildings, putting a particular focus on scopes of prediction, used algorithms, data sources and sizes, besides evaluation metrics. This work should improve architects’ decision-making and increase the applicability to predict daylighting.

The proposed methodology evaluates the design development process in terms of decisions on building physics and building geometry during the early design stages to maximize human thermal comfort conditions and reduce cooling load requirements. The methodology integrates a detailed three-dimensional (3D) building and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling within a building information modeling (BIM) platform during the design development stage, which is developed and structured to optimize the evaluation process. The operational characteristics of the building in respect of windows and shutters have important effects on natural ventilation, which in turn influences thermal comfort, and cooling load. Thus, the multi-interaction analysis of natural ventilation is considered with operational schemes of enveloping that are integrated into a 3D model of the building, which is further transformed to a CFD model. Then, four scenarios using a manually operated building opening are created using the BIM platform. Thus, multi-interactions are achieved by developing a 3D-building model, that not only include the building's functions and physical specifications but also incorporates the envelope's thermal capacity coupled with openings that have various operational scenarios for natural ventilation. The results show that the correlation between the air temperature and velocity can provide a comfort zone and decrease the cooling load for energy consumption. The numerical results for one scenario 2 show that if the temperature and velocity values are increased together, human sensation as predicted mean vote (PMV) ranges from 0 to 2, which is considered tolerable for summer comfort, whilst the cooling load is reduced by almost 3%. © 2020 The Authors","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:05","2024-02-20 10:30:55","","644-661","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2020.02.001","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Structural design; Design process; Three-dimensional (3D) buildings; BIM; Energy utilization; Air conditioning; Natural ventilation; Ventilation; Thermal comfort; Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; 3D modeling; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; CFD analysis; Design with natural ventilation; Operational characteristics; Optimization of design process; Physical specifications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a holistic approach for energy-efficient design over the life cycle of buildings is necessary. In this work, the relationships between structural efficiency, energetic performance, and aesthetic design are explored in the context of tall buildings. The goal is to reduce the structural mass in order to reduce embodied energy while considering operational energy as well as the aesthetic expression of the structure. For this, we propose a framework that integrates code-based structural design of tall buildings with energy demand simulations, and perform a multiobjective optimization for a tall building in various climate zones. We show that structure can act as shading, that is, cooling savings are achieved with respect to a fully glazed building. Further, we illustrate the trade-offs between buildings with reduced mass, with comparatively little cooling savings, and heavier buildings, with increased cooling savings potential, for example, up to 50%. Finally, we discuss the impact of the column design in different climate zones. The resulting trade-offs allow the architect to make an informed decision between structural design and energy efficiency of the building without sacrificing the architectural intent. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:05","2024-03-19 12:32:04","","","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 7</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\UAHPG4F2\Felkner et al. - 2019 - Framework for Balancing Structural Efficiency and .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000355","Architectural design; Structural analysis; Structural design; Tall buildings; Life cycle; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy performance; Energy-efficient design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Holistic approach; Informed decision; Structural optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Operational energy; Savings potential; Structural efficiencies; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 3_Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This interest is strengthened by the fact that sustainable measures help in reducing negative social and environmental impacts of buildings. For that, this paper aims to develop a mixed integer optimization model that aids architects/designers and owner representatives during design stage in selecting building materials taking into consideration costs and risks that are involved in the selection process. The model is developed as a simulation optimization tool based on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system for new construction. The developed model allows deterministic and probabilistic cost analysis of various design alternatives. In addition, it identifies the least possible cost to gain the LEED credits and the risks associated with materials’ quantities and materials’ unit prices. To illustrate the use of the proposed tool, a case study of an office building project constructed in Egypt is presented. An integrated Fuzzy Monte Carlo Simulation (FMCS) analysis is performed to account for the associated risks of using new materials in the considered case study.

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element.

However, in the majority of previous studies, the variables in energy-efficient building designs were treated separately by using bivariate-orthogonal methods, and the effects of multivariable interactions were largely neglected. This study focused on the impact and relationships of multiple design factors in three classical glass roof forms (flat, arch and zigzag) in Nanjing, China. Architectural features including glass roof shape flatness, glazing orientation, glazing distribution, glazing material properties were parameterized. The response surface methodology was applied to the simulation design, mathematical model generation and optimization. This study revealed that when compared to the maximum energy demand, up to 87%, 92% and 89% of total energy demand could be saved in the flat, arch and zigzag glass roof designs, respectively. Moreover, in hot summer/cold winter climate regions like the city Nanjing, glazing material properties (U and Tvis) and shape flatness (tan α) had significant impacts on energy demands while glass roof glazing orientation could be neglected. Although generally a glass roof with a flatten shape using low Tvis and U-value material was preferable, multiple optimal solutions with the same desirability of energy-saving were obtained in different settings for arch and zigzag glass roofs. The optimal values for factors U, Tvis and tan α of the zigzag glass roof were distributed over a significant larger range than those of the arch form. The results indicated that the more factors with interactions were taken into considerations, the more possible solutions might be obtained to reach optimal goals, and the restrictions on each factor would be less. The findings regarding the substitutional relations of the research factors have challenged the belief that the relationship between a design factor and energy demand is unidirectional, and therefore may be important for decision-making in energy-saving designs. © 2020","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:06","2024-02-20 10:06:06","","760-772","","","201","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","","","design method; optimization; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Decision making; Simulation; Energy conservation; Roofs; Intelligent buildings; energy conservation; Glazes; Glass; simulation; Surface properties; methodology; Arches; Energy-saving; Glass roof; Glass roofs; Multi variables; Multivariable interaction; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; response surface methodology; Response surface methodology; roof","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its poorer heat insulation performance can decrease indoor thermal comfort. Therefore, the interlayer of insulating glazed roof is injected with phase change material (PCM) to improve the indoor thermal environment of building and reduce the energy consumption, while obtain sufficient indoor light. Based on enthalpy method, a numerical heat transfer model of double-slope PCM glazed roof was established and verified in this paper. The heat transfer performance of double-slope hollow glazed roof and double-slope PCM glazed roof were compared. Finally, the design of double-slope PCM glazed roof in hot summer and cold winter area was optimized by further studying the roof angle, phase change layer thickness, glazing layer thickness, the melting temperature and phase change latent heat of PCM. The results show that the suitable melting temperature is 26–30 °C under the typical climate of hot summer and cold winter in Wuhan. Increasing the thickness of phase change layer and glazing layer can improve the thermal insulation performance of the roof, but the former effect is more significant. Moreover, a smaller roof angle within a certain range can reduce the amount of solar radiation received by the roof, and a larger latent heat energy of PCM can absorb more solar radiation to improve the heat transfer performance of the roof. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:06","2024-02-20 10:06:06","","","","","223","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 22</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Numerical methods; Energy utilization; Numerical simulation; Roofs; Thermal insulation; Double-slope glazed roof; Electric circuit breakers; Glazes; Heat transfer performance; Hot summer and cold winters; Indoor thermal comfort; Indoor thermal environments; Insulation performance; Latent heat; Melting point; Numerical heat transfer; Phase change latent heat; Phase change layer; Phase change materials; Physical parameters; Solar radiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The feasibility of thermal intervention was examined by temperature simulations (f = 300, 400 and 500 MHz) in a phantom. The RF heating intervention (Pin = 100 W, t = 120 seconds) was validated experimentally using the proton resonance shift method and fiberoptic probes for temperature monitoring.

As such, meticulous planning is required to ensure that both the aesthetic and structural integrity of joints between cast in-situ components is achieved. Failure to adequately plan concrete pouring could lead to structural defects, construction rework or structural instability, all having major financial implications. Given the inherent complexity of large-scale construction projects, the ‘manual planning’ of concrete pouring is a challenging task and prone to human errors. Against this backdrop, this study developed 4D Building Information Management (BIM) approach to facilitate automated concrete joint positioning solution (as a proof of concept) for design professionals and contractors. The study first developed structural model in Revit, then extracted spatial information regarding all construction joints and linked them to dynamic Microsoft (MS) Excel and Matlab spreadsheets using integration facilitated by Dynamo software. Midspan points of each beam as well as floor perimeter information were gathered via codes developed in MS Excel macros. Based on the Excel outputs, Matlab programming was used to determine best concreating starting points and directions, and daily allowed concrete volume, considering limitations due to cold joints. These information were then pushed back to Revit via Dynamo in order to develop daily concrete scheduling. The developed automated programme framework offers a cost-effective and accurate methodology to address the limitations and inefficiencies of traditional methods of designing construction joints and planning pours. This framework extends the body of knowledge by introducing innovative solutions to integrate structural design considerations, constructional procedures and operational aspects for mitigating human error, and providing a novel, yet technically sound, basis for further application of BIM in structural engineering. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:07","2024-02-20 10:31:35","","","","","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 56</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\QGI4FETS\1-s2.0-S0926580519305084-main.pdf; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\UP93ULXS\1-s2.0-S0926580519305084-main.pdf; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\8W947ZDX\Sheikhkhoshkar et al. - 2019 - Automated planning of concrete joint layouts with .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102943","Architectural design; Automation; Concretes; Optimisations; Structural design; Cost effectiveness; Optimisation; Structural engineer; Structural optimization; Information management; Digital engineering; MATLAB; 4D BIM; Concrete design; Concrete scheduling; Errors; Integrated concrete design; Interactive devices; Scheduling; Structural engineers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The initial population evolves through series of crossover between current solutions (parent) followed by mutations generating new solutions to be adopted, for the next iteration, when they improve the performance criteria. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to a widely used type of reinforced concrete (RC) wall-slab system for which general structural rules are first elaborated prior to the genetic algorithm implementation.

Additionally, the results of a preliminary survey are presented on the visual perceptions of different patterns of perforated metal sheets. Then the behaviour of these configurations is addressed, through a complete “Energyplus® model” (design builder). A test campaign on a reference perforated screen mounted on a service building of reference was fully monitored over one year, supported by thermographic data recorded for additional validation purposes during the same period. The new parametric energy assessment takes additional variables into account, such as orientation and location of the façade, demonstrating that the real performance for such enclosures greatly depends on them.

To this end, a parametric representation of each system component (soil with excavation, tunnel lining with grouting, Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) and buildings) is developed in an information model for three LoDs (high, medium and low) and used for the automated generation of numerical models of the tunnel construction process and soil-structure interaction. The platform enables a flexible, user-friendly generation of the tunnel structure for arbitrary alignments based on predefined structural templates for each component, supporting the design process and at the same time providing an insight into the stability and safety of the design. This model, with selected optimal LoDs for each component, dependent on the objective of the analysis, is used for efficient design and process optimisation in mechanized tunnelling. Efficiency and accuracy are further demonstrated through an error-free exchange of information between Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the numerical simulation and with significantly reduced computational effort. The interoperability of the proposed multi-level framework is enabled through the use of an efficient multi-level representation context of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC).

In the optimization analysis, seven ground motions are scaled to three levels (corresponding to the service level, the design basis, and the maximum considered earthquakes, respectively) and the genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal pendulum parameters. The optimization results are compared with those obtained by the single-degree-of-freedom model, where significant difference is observed, showing the necessity of the presented study.

This paper presents a comparative study of two methods to produce future climate hourly data files for BES: Morphing and typical meteorological year of future climate (F-TMY). The study uses data from a high-resolution (9 km) regional climate atmospheric model simulation of Iberia, spanning 10 years of historical and future hourly data. This study compares both methods by analyzing anomalies in air temperature, and the impact in BES predictions of annual and peak energy consumption for space heating, cooling and ventilation in 4 buildings. Additionally, this study performs a sensitivity analysis of morphing method. The analysis shows that F-TMY is representative of the multi-year simulation for BES applications. A high-quality Morphed TMY weather file has a similar performance compared to F-TMY (average difference: 8% versus 7%).

Data about 16 buildings from three universities were collected. Relevant, inferential statistical analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of the building parameters on the energy consumed in the buildings. Also, regression models within building parameters were developed independently and in a combination that could be used to estimate energy consumption in the university buildings. Findings: Findings suggested that building and indoor environmental parameters of humidity, indoor temperature, volume, illumination, and window width ratio (WWR), in that order, influenced energy consumption significantly, and also, had direct empirical relationships. Practical implications: Optimising the building and indoor environmental parameters in design will enhance energy-efficiency in university buildings in South Africa. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in terms of understanding the order of influence of building parameters on energy consumption in university buildings in the temperate climatic zone of South Africa.

The generated future climate data combined with comfort model assessment has been proposed as a new way including future climate scenarios in preliminary building design for two representative sites, in Rome, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden. The existing vulnerability to the expected climate conditions from psychometric analysis indicates that: (1) the climate trend in Rome would gradually lead to more failures in the majority of conventional adaptive design measures, as the cooling and dehumidification demands would rise from 5.3% to 23.6%, while the heating and humidification demands would decrease from 27% to 16%; (2) the climate trend in Stockholm would result in an increased comfort period by exploiting more adaptive design measures, since the heating and humidification demands would be reduced from 67% to 53%. However, the cooling and dehumidification demands would increase slightly from 0% to 1.5%. Accordingly, four main key risks are identified: 1) overheating would become a rising increasing public health threat for buildings in Rome that rely exclusively on natural ventilation; 2) open questions remain for the design team in the area of correct cooling load selection, additional space for the future installation and the effectiveness of current cooling device etc.; 3) occasional heat waves and gradual rising humidity levels are expected to be a vulnerable topic for conventional lightweight building in Stockholm; 4) buildings with a heavy heating load would tend to have greater cooling demand, especially those with poor ventilation resources or greater internal gains.

Researchers have found that architectural design knowledge, such as symmetry, planarity, parallelism, and orthogonality, can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of such BIM reconstruction. Following this line of enquiry, this paper aims to develop a novel semantic registration approach for complicated scenes with repetitive, irregular-shaped objects. The approach first formulates the architectural repetition as the multimodality in mathematics. Thus, the reconstruction of repetitive objects becomes a multimodal optimization (MMO) problem of registering BIM components which have accurate geometries and rich semantics. Then, the topological information about repetition and symmetry in the reconstructed BIM is recognized and regularized for BIM semantic enrichment. A university lecture hall case, consisting of 1.9 million noisy points of 293 chairs, was selected for an experiment to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results showed that a BIM was satisfactorily created (achieving about 90% precision and recall) automatically in 926.6 s; and an even more satisfactory BIM achieved 99.3% precision and 98.0% recall with detected semantic and topological information under the minimal effort of human intervention in 228.4 s. The multimodality model of repetitive objects, the repetition detection and regularization for BIM, and satisfactory reconstruction results in the presented approach can contribute to methodologies and practices in multiple disciplines related to BIM and smart city. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:08","2024-02-20 10:06:08","","","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 37</p>","","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Structural design; Information theory; Topology; Semantics; Three dimensional computer graphics; Building information model; 3D point cloud; Architectural repetition; Image reconstruction; Multi-modal optimization; Multimodal optimization; Object detection; Semantic enrichment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, very few study is concerned with robust design optimization of building envelopes for zero/low energy buildings. In this study, the applicability of commonly-used objective functions for robust design optimization of buildings is analyzed and compared. The robust optimal design for envelopes of zero/low energy buildings in subtropical regions is studied. Major uncertain design inputs, which have significant effects on building performance in subtropical regions, are identified. An artificial neural network model is used for building performance evaluation to reduce computational time. Results show that it is necessary to consider uncertainties for zero/low energy building design as they have significant impacts.

Compared with conventional manufacturing methods such as tooling and molding, the design constraints induced by AM usually include support structures, building direction (BD), feedstock material properties, and process parameters. These new factors need to be considered in AM-driven product design and manufacturing. In this study, an AM-driven topology optimization method coupled with a transversely isotropic material model and solid anisotropic material with penalization (SAMP) is proposed to establish a quantitative correlation between process-related parameters and the mechanical properties of printed materials, further implementing such correlation for process and topology optimization using a gradient-based algorithm. Specifically, the coordinate transformation matrix is combined with the transversely isotropic stiffness and strength of the printed material using stereolithography apparatus (SLA) to describe the elastic matrix under different BDs.

Nevertheless, multicollinearity can nullify the reliability of SRCs. This study aims to develop a method for estimating reliable SRCs of design variables in daylighting and energy performance of buildings in the face of multicollinearity. A parametric model is developed, then, daylight and energy simulations are commenced, next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed and the extracted Principal Components (PCs) are interpreted to meaningful factors, finally, the SRCs of the extracted PCs in daylighting and energy performance were calculated. The method was applied to a standard office, where the quantitative performance of (3564) different cases were predicted in terms of twelve urban context configurations against nine variables. Four PCs out of nine variables were extracted, namely, PC1: window geometry, PC2: glazing properties, PC3: opposing building paint, and PC4: building paint. The generated SRCs charts of the extracted PCs described the behaviors of the PCs in daylighting and energy performance. The Horizontal Obstruction Angle (HOA) affected the PCs’ behavior for all performance metrics, Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) was not affected by PC3 and PC4, PC1 had an inverse relationship with Lighting Energy (LE), whilst, the contribution of PC3 on LE was increased dramatically when a steep HOA existed. Total Energy Consumption (TEC) showed the same trend as Cooling Energy (CE). The resulted behaviors were consistent with the literature and confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:08","2024-02-20 10:06:08","","1184-1193","","","211","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 19</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; building; Energy efficiency; Building performance; Machine learning; regression analysis; Regression analysis; performance assessment; Energy utilization; Energy; Daylighting; Inverse problems; Daylight simulation; simulation; daylight; detection method; Energy performance of buildings; estimation method; Inverse relationship; Multicollinearity; Paint; Parametric modeling; Performance metrics; Principal component analysis; Principal Components; Standardized regression coefficients; Total energy consumption (TEC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In reality, however, upstream revisions are usually substantive: significant work in the schematic design and design development phases are due to resolving upstream issues. That said, within the conceptual design and initial phase, the process is mostly linear. This work presents a set of tools that move towards an integrated design optimization, where the building’s form and structure are optimized together and not as separate stages in the design.

These are all accompanied by examples of their use in applied building projects or more general structural engineering problems.

Recent research also indicates its strong potential for the control of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, its high-order nature and slow computational speed limit its practical application in real-time HVAC optimal control. Therefore, this study proposes a practical control framework (named BEM-DRL) that is based on deep reinforcement learning. The framework is implemented and assessed in a novel radiant heating system in an existing office building as a case study. The complete implementation process is presented in this study, including: building energy modeling for the novel heating system, multi-objective BEM calibration using the Bayesian method and the Genetic Algorithm, deep reinforcement learning training and simulation results evaluation, and control deployment. By analyzing the real-life control deployment data, it is found that BEM-DRL achieves 16.7% heating demand reduction with more than 95% probability compared to the old rule-based control.

Unlike static shading, CABE systems include dynamic operations that significantly affect their performance; thus, well-informed strategies for scheduling dynamic operations should be integrated to analyze CABE performance. In this study, two conflicting objectives were pursued: minimizing cooling load and maximizing daylighting performance during the summer season in a hot and humid climate (Houston, Texas). Variables in the CABE performance optimization process were defined as dynamic operation schedules having either parametric linear or non-linear relationships between the degree of openness of the CABE model and certain weather stimuli (i.e., solar radiation). Two CABE models were tested with the PBM by integrating a parametric non-linear function that efficiently conducted the optimization process in a large search space. The outcomes of this optimization study included Pareto-front solutions such as optimal CABE performance and their dynamic operation scenarios. These optimal operation scenarios were determined based on the CABE design options available and user's desired objectives; in some cases, static scenarios were found to be superior. Ultimately, combining PBM with a MOO framework will contribute to the field of performance-based CABE design by supporting architects and engineers and facilitating better decisions through well-informed dynamic operation scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:06:09","2024-02-20 10:28:15","","","","","185","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 48</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107292","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; design; building; numerical model; Multiobjective optimization; performance assessment; Functions; United States; Building energy; Solar buildings; Performance optimizations; Daylighting; Conflicting objectives; cooling; decision making; Hot and humid climate; daylight; Building envelope design; Climate-adaptive kinetic facade; Design decision-making; Dynamic operations schedule; Houston; Multi objective optimization (MOO); Non-linear relationships; Optimization studies; Parametric behavior map (PBM); Scheduling dynamics; Texas; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These two groups of people view the resolution of such clashes from their own perspectives because of differences in their inherent knowledge and experience. To effectively improve the project delivery time, one option is to reduce the number of model revisions during the construction stage. This could be done by providing a BIM model as a reference. In this model, design clashes can be resolved from the perspective of the constructor before discussions in design coordination meetings to find compromises.

Building owners often seek to identify and implement building upgrade measures to improve building sustainability as well as to achieve green certifications such as the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) within available budgets. To support building owners and operators as well as building managers in this vital goal, this paper presents two optimization models that are capable of (1) maximizing LEED points for existing buildings within a user-defined upgrade cost, and (2) achieving a user-defined LEED certification level for existing buildings with minimum upgrade cost. These optimization models are developed in two main steps: (1) a formulation step which identifies the model decision variables and formulates objective functions and constraints; and (2) an implementation step which performs the model computations using genetic algorithms and generates results in both tabular and graphical formats. A case study of a large existing building located at University of Colorado Denver was used to illustrate the capabilities of the optimization models and demonstrate their use. The results of the case study showed strong support to building owners and operators to identify the optimal use of their upgrade budgets to achieve LEED certification. The optimization model was designed to generate an action report that can be used by building owners and operators, listing building fixtures and equipment that need to be upgraded, their location in building, expected energy and water reduction, and expected annual savings.

The simultaneous consideration of multiple and conflicting design objectives can make the architectural design process more complicated. This study is based on the fundamental recognition that optimising parameters on the building energy loads via window system design can reduce the quality of the view to outside and the received daylight – both qualities highly valued by building occupants. This paper proposes an approach for quantifying Quality of View in office buildings in balance with energy performance and daylighting, thus enabling an optimisation framework for office window design. The study builds on previous research by developing a multi-objective method of assessment of a reference room which is parametrically modelled using actual climate data. A method of Pareto Frontier and a weighting sum is applied for multi-objective optimisation to determine best outcomes that balance design requirements. The Results reveal the maximum possible window to wall ratio for the reference room. The optimisation model indicates that the room geometry should be altered to achieve the lighting and view requirements set out in building performance standards. The research results emphasise the need for window system configuration to be considered in the early design stages.

In the first step, engineers consider the possible number of segments and the connection method of segments. In this paper, a series of segments, called a segmentation pattern (SP), is obtained by the recognition of features and separating them automatically (or manually when needed) with one or more appropriate planes. In the second step, the best fabrication orientation should be chosen. The criteria for choosing the best SP and OPs are minimizing the support volume, building time (directly affected by segments’ height in layer-wise AM processes) and surface roughness. Both steps are performed automatically (or manually when needed) by the algorithm created based on principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using Visual C#. Findings: Experimental tests show that the segmentation design improves AM processes from the aspects of building time, material consumption and the surface quality. Segmentation design empowers users of AM technologies to reduce consumption of material by decreasing the support structures, to decrease the time of building by lowering the segments height and to decrease the surface roughness. Originality/value: This paper presents an original approach in efficiency improvement of AM technologies, thus bringing the AM one step closer to maturity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:09","2024-02-20 10:37:02","","1155-1168","","7","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-09-2018-0253","Architectural design; Structural design; Computer aided design; Design/methodology/approach; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Fabrication; Efficiency; 3D printers; Additives; Additive manufacturing; 3D modeling; Additive manufacturing technology; Building time; Computer aided design models; DLP; Efficiency improvement; Material consumption; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Segmentation design; Support structures; Surface roughness; Threedimensional (3-d)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional optimization techniques usually are aimed at achieving the globally optimal solution which maximizes the structural performance. In practical applications, however, designers usually desire to have multiple design options, as the single optimal design often limits their artistic intuitions and sometimes violates the functional requirements of building structures. Here we propose three stochastic approaches to generating diverse and competitive designs. These approaches include (1) penalizing elemental sensitivities, (2) changing initial designs, and (3) integrating the genetic algorithm into the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are capable of producing a series of random designs, which possess not only high structural performance, but also distinctly different topologies. These approaches can be easily implemented in different topology optimization techniques.

The structural efficiency of a gridshell is determined by its shape, which is traditionally designed using form-finding techniques. However, these techniques are primarily used to generate structures in pure tension or compression for a single load case only. In cases where classic form-finding techniques are not applicable, such as for cantilevering gridshells or simply supported gridshells, numerical optimization can be used to find a suitable shape. In this paper, an optimization procedure is proposed that optimizes the shape of a strained gridshell for a given grid. The forces applied to erect the gridshell are chosen as the design variables. These erection forces are optimized to minimize the so-called end-compliance, which is defined as the inner product of the external loads and the resulting displacements. The method of moving asymptotes is adopted to solve the optimization problem and implicit dynamic relaxation is used to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations. Geometric nonlinearity is taken into account by using co-rotational beam elements to model the gridshell laths. To validate the proposed approach, a 6×6 m2 prototype was built. The results show that this approach allows the structure to be optimized considering multiple load cases, while accounting for practical building constraints, and potential designer constraints. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:09","2024-03-12 15:48:50","","166-180","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 24</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\52IIX88X\Rombouts et al. - 2019 - A novel shape optimization approach for strained g.pdf","","Active bending; architectural design; bending; building construction; Co-rotational beams; construction method; Form finding; Form-finding; Geometric non-linearity; Method of moving asymptotes; Non-linear equilibrium equation; Nonlinear equations; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural design; structural component; Structural efficiencies; Numerical optimizations; Reticulated shell structure; shape; Strained gridshells; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 3_Stiffness; 7_Entire building; 5_Spatial; 2_Timber; 6_Prototyping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solar envelope is a method used during the schematic design phase to determine the maximum volume that buildings cannot exceed to guarantee good access to direct sunlight in streets and on neighboring facades. However, two major shortcomings exist that prohibit the use of existing solar envelope techniques in practice: They don’t include the neighboring buildings in the overshadowing calculation, and they utilize a fixed start-and-end time inputs for the selection of specific hours of direct solar access. Different direct solar access ordinances exist that require that new buildings do not obstruct direct sun light in existing dwellings: (1) during specific hours, (2) for a quantity of hours, (3) as a fraction of the actual solar access. For the second and third type of ordinances no existing solar envelope methodologies exist. The research presented in this paper develops a computational method that increases the efficacy of the generated solar envelopes including the context in the calculations and provides the possibility to select the quantity and quality of sun light hours, and thus allows the modeler to generate solar envelopes optimized for different objectives.

Previous studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the optimization of individual structural elements and the topological arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material cost are both reduced by 18–24% after performing optimization. The proposed approach can be extended to optimize other types of buildings (such as steel framework) with a similar problem nature, thereby improving the cost efficiency and environmental sustainability of the built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:09","2024-02-20 10:40:19","","","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 69</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2019.100962","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Reinforced concrete; High rise building; Computational optimization; Cost reduction; High-rise buildings; Optimality criteria; Structural optimization; Topology; Sustainable development; Parameter estimation; Parametric design; Intelligent buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a method for simulation-based investigations on the extent to which optimisation of the relation between indoor climate (whole-body thermal comfort and perceived air quality) and productivity, instead of – or in combination with – comfort based acceptance criteria, affect the cost-optimal design of office buildings. For this purpose, a single-objective optimisation problem was formulated and a calculation procedure was proposed. The results of a retrofit case study indicate that energy use and productivity loss can be reduced if building designers optimise with respect to productivity instead of comfort based constraints. Optimising productivity while respecting comfort based constraints led to a less but still profitable solution. The composition of an economic optimal retrofit solution thereby strongly depends on whether the building owner is willing to put an economic value on the effect of the retrofit solution on comfort and/or the relation between indoor climate and productivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:09","2024-02-20 10:06:09","","15-22","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 7</p>","","","Architectural design; Buildings; architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Optimization; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Retrofitting; Thermal comfort; temperature effect; Air quality; energy use; indoor air; Economic optimisation; Productivity; Building designers; air quality; Acceptance criteria; Calculation procedure; Cost-optimal design; Indoor climate; Perceived air quality; Retrofit solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In view of this, topology optimization has emerged as a new design technique which offers much more design freedom.

This study coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique and response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the most desirable wind comfort around an isolated building with lift-up design. A multi-variable optimization method is proposed to determine optimum wind comfort and the corresponding lift-up design variables, namely, lift-up height (HL), core aspect ratio (AR) and core number (N). To better illustrate wind comfort around the building, the wind comfort in the lift-up area and the podium area are investigated separately. The Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach is employed throughout the whole CFD simulation process. The quality and goodness of the established RSM models are examined by analysis of variance and genetic algorithm is applied to generate optimal design solution. The generated results illustrate good performance of the established RSM model. Results show that the optimum wind comfort is obtained when HL is 8 m, AR is 10%, and N is 6. The lift-up core aspect ratio is subsequently found to have greatest effect on wind comfort among the three design variables in both the lift-up area and the podium area.

In this regard, three different structures are considered; 5-, 10-, and 15-story buildings. Seven mainshock–aftershock sequences are selected from the Iranian accelerogram database for analyzing the structures. By implementing an advanced two-step optimization method, buildings equipped with the active vibration control system (linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm) are designed to withstand all events of mainshock–aftershock sequences. In the first optimization step, a multi-objective optimization with the genetic algorithm is performed and a set of optimal Pareto front results is obtained. In the next step, the life-cycle cost of each optimal design sample of the Pareto front is calculated by considering the cumulative damage and the design sample with the minimum cost is selected as a final optimal property. The results prove that the active vibration control system is capable of reducing structural responses, including acceleration, drift, and residual drift under mainshock–aftershock sequences, and consequently the life-cycle cost of buildings, especially the taller ones. In addition, obtaining the building design variables (story stiffness and yielding force) and active LQR algorithm properties simultaneously leads to a slightly softer final building model than the conventional structure designed by the common building design code. Moreover, it is revealed that, by considering the aftershocks, the building life-cycle cost increases significantly. © The Author(s) 2018.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:10","2024-03-12 16:00:30","","748-762","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\4CJK3DEW\Khansefid and Bakhshi - 2019 - Advanced two-step integrated optimization of activ.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077546318795533","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Earthquakes; Life cycle; Costs; Active control; Active vibration control systems; Aftershock sequence; Building performance; Control systems; Conventional structures; Integrated optimization; life-cycle cost; Multiobjective optimization; multi-objective optimization; Vibration control; Lifecycle costs; LQR algorithm; mainshock–aftershock sequence; Two-step optimizations; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stiffness; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 3_Vibration; 1_Others (stiffness, ...)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A modified Genetic Algorithm using real-integer hybrid coding with relative fitness as well as adaptive crossover and mutation rates (called RFAGA) is then proposed to identify the parameters of the modified Bouc-Wen model. A reliable approach to evaluating the fatigue performance of the MDs with respect to the Chinese Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (GB 50011-2010) is finally proposed based on the research results. Experimental data are employed to demonstrate the process and verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that the RFAGA is able to converge quickly in the identification process, and the simulation curves based on the identification results fit well with the experimental hysteresis curves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be a useful tool for evaluating the fatigue performance of MDs with respect to the Chinese Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (GB 50011-2010). © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:10","2024-02-20 10:06:10","","397-407","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","","Architectural design; Building codes; Codes (symbols); Structural design; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Seismic design; Seismology; Steel beams and girders; Parameter estimation; Hysteresis; Bouc Wen model; Bouc-Wen model; Engineering practices; Identification (control systems); Identification process; Mechanical performance; Metallic dampers; Metals; Modified bouc-wen models; Modified genetic algorithms; Parameter identification; Parametric identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of the research was to study how to integrate passive design strategies and energy-efficient building systems to improve building performance, and reduce the energy consumption of existing buildings in three different climate types (cold, mixed and hot climates). First, properties of existing buildings were analyzed based on national CBECS database to determine typical characteristics of office buildings located in Chicago, Baltimore and Phoenix, including size, building envelope treatment and building systems. Then, fourteen diffierent prototypes were developed, varying the building shape and orientation to represent diffierent building stock, and energy modeling was conducted to establish energy usage baseline. Multiple design considerations were investigated based on extensive energy simulations and modeling, where low-impact and deep retrofits were considered. Low-impact strategies included improvements to the building envelope, lighting systems and optimization of HVAC systems operation (without upgrading heating and cooling equipment). Deep energy retrofits also included improvements to building envelope and lighting, and considered changes and improvements to HVAC systems (specifically, integration of radiant systems). Energy modeling was conducted for all prototypes, and results were obtained for the baseline (current energy usage), and energy usage considering low-impact design strategies and deep retrofits. A total of 126 energy models was developed, simulated and analyzed, providing a dataset that captured energy usage for investigated scenarios. The comparative analysis of simulation results was used to determine how specific techniques lead to energy savings in different climate types, as well as for buildings of various shapes and orientations. © 2017, College Publishing.

Amongst structural materials, steel is characterised by its suitability to a large number of structures as well as a highly pollutant supply chain. Therefore, even a small reduction of the amount of steel currently used in building structures, would undoubtedly be beneficial towards the mitigation of environmental impacts. This paper presents a computational tool that aims to help practitioners to design material-efficient structures for multi-storey buildings frames. The tool is based on an optimisation framework, which –given a small set of input parameters defining the overall frame geometry and the system of loadings– seeks for optimised cross-sections for each structural member, based on a finite set of commercially available section profiles. Results are fully compliant with British and European standards for structural design. The user can therefore quickly and reliably assess a wide range of alternative frame layouts in a nearly real-time frame. To avoid misleading the decision-maker with very definite numbers, both structural mass and embodied carbon coefficients are considered along with their uncertainty through Montecarlo simulation. The final output consists of a probability density function of the embodied carbon for the specific structural design under consideration. The mathematical model which underpins the tool has been extensively validated. Results of an application to a practical example show a carbon emissions reduction potential of 23%. To maximise the impact of the research findings, the described work has been implemented into a plug-in tool for a widely used CAD software. This will help practitioners to take into account embodied carbon consideration early on in the design process when the room for improvement is greatest and the economic repercussions of design changes are low. This tool represents a fundamental first step to translate research on embodied carbon reduction into a means that is useful to, and usable by, industry professionals to mitigate building-related carbon emissions and progress towards national and international carbon targets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:10","2024-03-06 09:56:52","","236-250","","","168","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 25</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\JAMP92E2\D'Amico and Pomponi - 2018 - Accuracy and reliability A computational tool to .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.031","Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Optimisations; Design; Structural design; Computer aided design; Life cycle; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; Computational methods; Early stage; Emission control; Frame; GHG emission; GHG Emissions; Optimisation; Parametric; Probability density function; Steel; Supply chains; 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Part of Building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This imposes a vital limitation on the application of machine learning in building design. In this paper, we present a component-based approach that develops machine learning models not only for a parameterized whole building design, but for parameterized components of the design as well. Two decomposition levels, namely construction level components (wall, windows, floors, roof, etc.), and zone-level components, are examined.

Three analysis models representing various tall buildings with outriggers were used to perform the optimum design of the outrigger, which is subject to the lateral displacement constraint. The results demonstrate that as the number of outriggers used was increased, the total volume of the outriggers decreased. However, the performance of the outriggers remained almost the same when the number of the outriggers was greater than two. The optimum locations of the outriggers were slightly higher than those from the analytical solutions with simplified assumptions.

Smart environments usually rely on several hardware nodes equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication functionalities. The high level of heterogeneity and the lack of standardization across technologies make design of such environments a very challenging task, as each installation has to be designed manually and performed ad-hoc for the specific building. On the other hand, many different systems show common characteristics, like the strict dependency with the building floor plan, also sharing similar requirements such as a nodes allocation that provides sensing coverage and nodes connectivity. This paper provides a computer-aided design application for the design of smart building systems based on the installation of hardware nodes across the indoor space. The tool provides a site-specific algorithm for cost-effective deployment of wireless localization systems, with the aim to maximize the localization accuracy.

Accurate assessment of the design wind load combinations for tall buildings on the basis of wind tunnel tests is an extremely important and complicated issue. The traditional design practice for determining wind load combinations relies partly on subjective judgments and lacks a systematic and reliable method of evaluating critical load cases. This paper presents a novel optimization-based framework for determining wind tunnel derived load cases for the structural design of wind sensitive tall buildings. The peak factor is used to predict the expected maximum resultant responses from the correlated three-dimensional wind loads measured at each wind angle. An optimized convex hull is further developed to serve as the design envelope in which the peak values of the resultant responses at any azimuth angle are enclosed to represent the critical wind load cases. Furthermore, the appropriate number of load cases used for design purposes can be predicted based on a set of Pareto solutions. One 30-story building example is used to illustrate the effectiveness and practical application of the proposed optimization-based technique for the evaluation of peak resultant wind-induced load cases.

In a scenario considering five parameters, each with ten variations, one has to simulate hundred thousand combinations. It requires a lot of computation to simulate energy consumption for all the input combinations. This paper aims at reducing the computation required to compute the energy consumption of all the combinations. This is done by identifying appropriate training samples, computing their energy consumption using EnergyPlus and estimating energy consumption of the rest of the data using machine learning techniques. This paper presents two sampling methods along with various regression techniques to predict energy consumption of a building in the early phase. It involves usage of efficient sampling methods for identifying the training data. The key contribution of this method of surrogate modeling is saving a lot of computation by reducing the computation by ~100-fold. This method is tested for Jaipur and Hyderabad cities of India. Approximately hundred thousand simulations are performed for each location using parallel computation. By simulating approximately one percent of the input combinations, annual energy consumption for the large set of combinations are predicted using SVR and k-means clustering for Jaipur with accuracy greater than 93% for 99.8% of the input combinations. When the same model is trained for Hyderabad, it produced accuracy greater than 93% for 98% of the input combinations. © 2018","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:12","2024-02-20 10:06:12","","38-52","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 18</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy simulation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Surrogate model; Energy utilization; Artificial intelligence; Energy conservation; Annual energy consumption; Green computing; Building energy consumption; K - means clustering; Machine learning techniques; Parallel Computation; Regression techniques; Speed gain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that commercial buildings can track a frequency regulation signal with high accuracy and minimal occupant discomfort in a realistic environment. In addition, we show that buildings can determine the reserve capacity and baseline power a priori, and identify the optimal tradeoff between frequency regulation and energy efficiency. In part I, we introduce the test facility and develop relevant building models. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical controller for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system that consists of three levels: 1) a reserve scheduler; 2) a building climate controller; and 3) a fan speed controller for frequency regulation. We formulate the reserve scheduler as a robust optimization problem and introduce several approximations to reduce its complexity. The building climate controller is comprised of a robust model predictive controller and a Kalman filter. The frequency regulation controller consists of a feedback and a feedforward loop, provides fast responses, and is stable. Part I presents building model identification and controller tuning results. Specifically, we find out that with an appropriate formulation of the model identification problem, a two-state model is accurate enough for use in a reserve scheduler that runs day-ahead.

Due to a lack of computational design methodologies, existing digital design workflows do little in predicting design performance in the early design stage and in most cases analysis and design optimization are done after a design is fixed. This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters’ architectural design components (i.e. façade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents’ behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a façade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative façade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the façade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for façade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software. © The Author(s) 2018.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:12","2024-02-20 10:27:56","","248-270","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 17</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\3RDE22L4\Pantazis and Gerber - 2018 - A framework for generating and evaluating façade d.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1478077118805874","Architectural design; Structural design; Conceptual design; Computational methods; Geometry; Stochastic systems; Systems analysis; Energy utilization; Stochastic models; Environmental management; Environmental performance; Generative design; Performance criterion; Environmental parameter; Agent-based model; agent-based modeling; Architectural geometry; Autonomous agents; façade design; Multi agent systems; multi-agent systems; stochastic search; Stochastic search; Three-dimensional model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study is focused on a single-family house (called BNZEB), placed in south Italy and specifically designed for a Mediterranean climate. The “Benevento” Nearly Zero Energy Building (that is why the name is “BNZEB”) is built with the purpose to be, at the same time, a research laboratory, suitable for testing and measuring energy demands, renewable energy conversion, indoor environmental quality and other aspects of performances in a realistic context. More in detail, firstly the BNZEB is presented and described; then, the early results of a monitoring campaign are shown with the purpose to characterise the energy performance of this building during the summer season and verify the effectiveness of chosen design solutions. For this reason, the daily energy balance is proposed with the aim to evidence the impact of solar production and electric storage on building energy consumptions. It is really important the presentation and the discussion about the monitoring results because, very often, the real performance does not coincide with the expected one and further optimizations are needed. Subsequently, a numerical model of the case study building, suitable for performing transient energy simulations, is used to compare the BNZEB building with other buildings: (a) one representative of the constructive standard established by Italian law; (b) a second one typical of the not-refurbished buildings stock of the city. The aim of this last part is to understand how much the BNZEB's energy performances are better compared to reference buildings during the summer season.

The growing concerns on preserving energy as well as ecological impacts of conventional energy resources have resulted in a demand for green buildings. The insulation of external wall has an important impact on the decrease of energy consumption in building design projects that decreases SO2–CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to determine the optimal thickness of natural insulation material in regards to heating loads at different provinces for a sandwich wall. The optimal insulation thickness in building envelope for fourteen different provinces from two climatic regions is studied. For the region of Eastern Anatolia, payback periods, emissions of SO2–CO2, and energy savings over 10 years of lifetime, based on insulation thickness and sensitivity analysis are calculated using three types of fuel sources (natural gas, fuel-oil, and coal) and four of the most eco-efficient natural insulation materials (Wood Fiber Plate, Wood Wool Slab, Expanded Perlite, Expanded Cork) based on global warming potential (kg CO2-Eq/kg) and water demand (l/kg). Ecological and financial analyses of insulation materials are conducted by an algorithm designed in LINGO optimization software. Results of sensitivity analysis display that the energy saving from natural insulation materials is bigger, more effective, and the payback period is shorter for higher degree-day cities. The study shows that the application of eco-efficient materials in buildings has the potential of substituting the conventional materials. © 2017","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:12","2024-02-20 10:06:12","","1-14","","","148","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 24</p>","","","Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Investments; Energy conservation; Global warming; Global warming potential; Insulation; Insulation thickness; Historic preservation; Ecology; Green building; Green buildings; Structural Design; Carbon Dioxide; Conventional materials; Eco-efficient; Ecological evaluation; Energy Consumption; Energy resources; Energy savings; Gas fuel analysis; Insulating materials; Insulation materials; Optimal insulation thickness; Optimization software; Permafrost; Sulfur dioxide; Wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine the optimum wind environment and outdoor thermal comfort for an ideal urban canyon in which the buildings have lift-up designs. A multi-stage optimization method is proposed consisting of three stages for the optimization process, e.g., surrogate model development, multi-objective optimization, and decision-making. An area weighted wind velocity parameter (MVR¯) and an outdoor thermal comfort parameter (PET¯) are chosen as the design objectives, and four design variables are selected. The response surface methodology combining computational fluid dynamics simulation results are used to fit surrogate models. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is employed to find Pareto optimal solutions, and three decision-making strategies are adopted to determine the final optimum design solution in parallel. The optimization process of the ideal urban canyon confirms that the proposed method is highly effective to determine optimum building design in urban areas.

The model is applied to the sustainable design of shear walls installed in a 42-story mixed-use building. The characteristics in the change in CO                             2                              emissions and the construction cost according to the building height were analyzed using the slenderness ratio as a variable.

In particular, when the slenderness ratio increased from 4.40 to 4.93, which is known to be the limit of the efficient applicability of shear walls, the CO                             2                              emissions tended to increase more rapidly.

The FEA models, which account for nonlinear material properties of both timber and steel components, were validated against experimental results. The primary objective of this research was to optimise the connector geometry and material properties to achieve a target yield capacity of 85 kN. Considering a capacity-based design approach, where all the wood components remain elastic and only the steel tube deforms, a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the input-performance correlations. It was shown that the diameter (d) and thickness (t) of the tube, as well as the coupler diameter (c) were the main parameters influencing the yield capacity and overall performance of the connection. The subsequent optimisation resulted in an optimum detailing with d = 155 mm, t = 9.5 mm and c = 30 mm, and a required steel yield stress of approx. 800 MPa. With a load-carrying capacity of 98 kN, an elastic stiffness of 30 kN/mm, and a ductility of 9, the connection was deemed suitable for the design of resilient CLT buildings.

Safety is invariably considered the main factor and environmental criteria (or, in general, sustainability) is seldom given due consideration. However, similar safety indicators can be achieved with different variables and a minimum safety factor must always be ensured. The main objective of this study is, from an environmental perspective, to assess the influence of the construction system (cast-in-situ or precast), foundation type (rigid or flexible), and structural code (EC-2 or EHE-08) in the case of a concrete shallow foundation (CSF), using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Applying this methodology, the materials (concrete and steel) yielded the highest impacts in all categories, at around 95% for cast-in-situ CSFs and at around 85% for precast CSFs, both in relation to global warming. Consequently, optimization of the amount of these materials is crucial when considering the particular variables selected in this study. The results showed that cast-in-situ and flexible CSFs at moderately shallow depths (and therefore with less steel reinforcement) and precast CSFs with considerable reductions in concrete volumes (due to sloped shapes) had lower environmental impacts. In addition, cast-in-situ CSFs constructed in accordance with the EHE-08 structural code showed lower impacts, while precast CSFs complying with the EC-2 code were environmentally preferable. However, a specific study might be required for specific factors in each case (loads, soil type, structural settlement, among others). Relevant environmental effects associated with the three variables should therefore be given specific consideration in the development of structural design codes and future constructions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:13","2024-02-20 10:36:10","","407-417","","","186","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 19</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\6EITMIH3\Pujadas-Gispert et al. - 2018 - Environmental analysis of building shallow foundat.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.105","Architectural design; Buildings; Codes (symbols); Concretes; Structural design; Life cycle; Ecodesign; Sustainable development; Safety factor; Structural design codes; Environmental impact; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment; Precast concrete; Global warming; Building; EHE-08; Environmental analysis; Concrete; EC-2; Foundations; Minimum safety factor; Shallow foundation; Shallow foundations; Structural settlement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are still many deficiencies in the design and technology of existing systems, especially in terms of the integration of architectural performance defects that cannot respond to occupants' comfort, flexibility, and energy-saving requirements throughout the building's life cycle. This research takes modular prefabricated steel structural systems as its research object and sets the detailed design of an integrated modular envelope system as the core content. First, the researcher chose two types of thermal insulation materials, high insulation panels and aerogel blankets, in order to study the construction details of integrated building envelopes for modular prefabricated buildings. Focusing on the weakest heat point, the thermal bridge at the modular connection point, this work used construction design and research to build an experimental building and full-scale model; the goal was to explore and verify the feasibility of the climate-responsive construction technique called ""reverse install."" Second, as a response to climate change, building facades were dynamically adjusted by employing different modular building envelope units such as sunshades, preheaters, ventilation, air filtration, pest control, and other functional requirements in order to improve the building's climate adaptability. Finally, based on the above structural design and research, this study verified the actual measurements and simulation, as well as the sustainability performance of the structure during the operational phase, and provided feedback on the design.

These two goals are often misaligned because adaptation measures use additional materials and equipment, which can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This phenomenon means that building design involves tradeoffs between enhanced structural resilience and reduced GHG emissions. This paper seeks to identify the optimal investment allocation mechanisms between carbon mitigation and climate adaptation measures for the design of buildings in hurricane-prone regions. A dynamic decision-making model is developed to maximize individual investors’ expected payoffs over a building's lifetime. The model is based on the damage evaluation of non-stationary hurricane occurrence and building emission performance under different mitigation scenarios. The results reveal a transition from long-advocated low-carbon investments to risk-oriented portfolios for building retrofits. A case study on Anne Arundel County, MD, for which a “60-40” resilience/abatement portfolio is recommended, shows the value of enhancing structural resilience. Discretion on the accuracy of insurance premium discounts is needed to support risk mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, subsidies for emission abatements are recommended to accommodate existing emission trading schemes and building property values. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:13","2024-02-20 10:06:13","","257-267","","","177","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Commerce; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; Resilience; Allocation mechanism; Dynamic decision making; Dynamic optimization; Emission abatement; Emission performance; Emission trading scheme; Greenhouse gas; Hurricane risk; Hurricanes; Insurance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach is restricted by the development of economy, progress of energy-saving technologies and climate change. In present work, a novel building energy efficiency evaluation index is developed to represent building energy saving performance. A building model can be first established according to architectural design scheme, current standards and operating conditions. Then, average daily indoor air temperature would be obtained using hourly outdoor air temperature as input conditions, with the one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer model. Finally, the calculation equations of energy saving of envelopes (ΔS) and building energy saving rate (BESR) are derived. In application, a building envelopes trade-off option is proposed and a target building in Western China is employed for case study. The results indicate that, about 19.3% of whole energy achieving indoor human thermal comfort is provided by building envelopes for the target building. The parametric analyses indicate that, BESRs of the standard building model in cold climate zone (2A) are much higher than those in cold climate zone (2B) in China.

This study was conducted to develop an optimization model that simultaneously takes into consideration the occupants’ thermal comfort, thermal energy consumption, and life cycle economic-environmental values. To this end, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted involving the analysis of the thermal comfort and thermal energy consumption through the EnergyPlus, and the quantification of the economic-environmental values through a life cycle cost analysis and life cycle assessment analysis. For the validation of the proposed model, a case study was conducted. A library facility in a monsoon climate as the target was chosen for this. A total of 4.26 × 1012 possible building design scenarios (31 window types × two ventilation types × 812 (eight set points: 18–25 °C, 1 °C intervals per month)) were generated and used to calculate the optimal building design solution. Based on the tables for making a better decision, trade-off analyses among the five optimization objectives were conducted. In terms of efficiency, the results showed that the time required for determining the optimal solution was only 2 s for each scenario, excluding the EnergyPlus running time. The proposed model may therefore be applied to other energy-saving techniques and buildings. © 2019","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:14","2024-02-20 10:06:14","","823-834","","","174","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 61</p>","","","Architectural design; architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Life cycle; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; cost analysis; Ecodesign; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental impact; life cycle analysis; Economic analysis; Environmental performance; Multi-objective optimization models; Thermal comfort; Energy; environmental quality; Indoor environmental quality; Artificial life; indoor air; behavior; economic analysis; Economic and environmental assessment; Economic and environmental assessments; energy; environmental assessment; Life cycle assessment analysis; model; Multi-disciplinary approach; multicriteria analysis; Occupant behavior; Thermal energy; Value engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy analysis has become more relevant during the early design phase in the AEC industry as these calculations are usually carried out at the end of the design process and do not give room for a variety of alternatives. Energy analysis needs to be incorporated in BIM to create alternative design options by the architects thereby predicting the usage of energy during the operational phase of a building. An architect requires optimising the operational energy need of a building at early design stage with limited parameters available and a simplified approach. This study identified the gap in a few selected and existing simulation tools and proposed a prototype model with minimum input variation to aid architects in estimating and optimising operational cooling energy during the early design phase.

The frames of these curtain walls are, usually, extruded aluminium – a material whose production is highly energy-intensive. Although means of enhancing the thermal performance of building envelopes have been scrutinized, comparatively little attention has been given to the cost and embodied energy savings that can be achieved through efficient structural design. No guidelines for efficient use of aluminium in a curtain wall have been published, and architects therefore have not known the impact that their decisions have upon the facade's material content. In this study more than 1000 unique curtain wall systems have been optimized numerically, each one to a different set of design criteria, and the results show the extent to which aluminium content is influenced by floor height, locations of supports, number of horizontal members per panel, width of the extrusions, spacing between mullions, design wind pressure, and the minimum allowable thickness of aluminium. The conditions in which the amount of metal required to construct a window wall (glazing spanning between two floors) might be less than that required for a curtain wall (an uninterrupted, multi-floor shroud), also have been explored. The results show that substantial metal savings – reductions of 40% or more – can be realized by making modest changes to the layout geometries and specifications that are in common use. The value of the corresponding construction cost reductions is significant: in the worldwide construction market, the potential savings are in billions of dollars per year. The practical steps that an architect and specifier should take in order to reduce metal content in a curtain wall are set out in a list. These savings are separate from, and in addition to, any that might be attained by optimizing the cross-sectional shapes of extrusion profiles. Unlike improvements in a facade's thermal performance, which usually require capital investment in insulating materials for returns that accrue over decades, material-efficient design methods are free to apply, and the benefits can be enjoyed immediately. © 2017 Institution of Structural Engineers","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:14","2024-03-25 09:26:15","","8-25","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 22</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\L4B2UIQ7\Lee et al. - 2018 - Optimizing the architectural layouts and technical.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2017.10.004","Architectural design; Floors; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Energy efficiency; Cost reduction; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Topology optimization; Wind effects; Walls (structural partitions); Embodied energy; Investments; Layout optimization; Green building; Green buildings; Technical specifications; Facade design; Topology optimisation; Aluminum; Curtain wall; Curtain-walls; Extruded aluminum; Extrusion; Large buildings; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting); 2_Others (aluminium); 7_Part of Building (Curtain wall)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the optimization procedures are presented, in which correlations from multivariable regression from our earlier study on generic urban street canyons are applied as the design guidelines for the arcade to maximize the ACH⋆. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are extended to take into consideration buildings with an arcade of optimum height and width in actual urban canyons to determine the effectiveness of the optimization procedures used to design arcade buildings for enhancing city breathability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:15","2024-02-20 10:06:15","","247-261","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 54</p>","","","Architectural design; Buildings; multistorey building; optimization; Structural design; Fluid dynamics; Urban planning; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; Arches; Optimization procedures; urban planning; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; urban design; Arcade design; Characteristic frequencies; City breathability; Half open spaces; Multivariable regression; Optimization procedure; street canyon; Urban street canyon; Urban street canyons; Ventilation performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since most of the structural material in a building exists within the floors, these present a significant opportunity for structural engineers to contribute to a more sustainable construction industry. This paper examines a novel flooring system of textile-reinforced concrete shells with a foamed concrete fill, which has the potential to halve the amount of materials in a building's entire structure. A new design and geometry optimisation method is described, as well as the construction and testing of two prototypes; each 18 mm thick, 2 m in span and 200 mm tall. These textile-reinforced concrete shells are unconventional in their low total depth, low reinforcement content and lack of rigid supports. Both were reinforced with AR-glass fibre textile and constructed using fine-grained concrete, however only one featured a foamed concrete fill. Each was tested to destruction under an asymmetric load. In both cases, a hinged collapse mechanism was formed rather than sudden catastrophic failure, with positive implications for safety and robustness. A non-linear finite element model was developed which replicated the observed behaviour well, including cracking patterns. Inaccuracies in geometry arising from the hand-made construction methods were measured and their structural impact was assessed and found to be small. The investigations confirm the strength, robustness and buildability of the structural system, and establish a reliable analysis method. © 2018 Institution of Structural Engineers","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:15","2024-03-19 10:42:47","","60-71","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\FCL63W6Z\Hawkins et al. - 2019 - Design, Construction and Testing of a Low Carbon T.pdf","","Architectural design; Carbon; Concrete shells; Floors; Structural design; Reinforced concrete; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Low carbon; Shape optimisation; Textile reinforced concrete; Textile reinforced concretes; Textiles; Sustainable construction; Population statistics; Concrete testing; Design construction; Foamed concrete; Reinforced concrete shells; Shape-optimization; Structural testing; Thin shells; Well testing; 1_Shape; 2_Composite (Concrete, Steelrod); 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 6_Prototyping; 7_Building_Component (Floor slab)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, steel reinforcement design is performed manually or semi-automatically using computer software such as ETABS, with reference to building codes. These approaches are time consuming and sometimes error-prone. Recent advances in building information modeling (BIM) technology allow digital 3D BIM models to be leveraged for supporting different types of engineering analyses such as structural engineering design. With the aid of BIM technology, steel reinforcement design could be automated for fast, economical and error-free procedures. This paper presents a BIM-based framework using the developed three-stage hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) for automated optimization of steel reinforcement in RC frames. The methodology framework determines the selection and alignment of steel reinforcement bars in an RC building frame for the minimum steel reinforcement area, considering longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive and shear steel reinforcement. The first two stages optimize the longitudinal tensile and longitudinal compressive steel reinforcement while the third stage optimizes the shear steel reinforcement. International design code (BS8110) and buildability constraints are considered in the developed optimization framework. A BIM model in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is then automatically created to visualize the optimized steel reinforcement design results in 3D thereby facilitating design communication and generation of construction detailing drawings. A three-storey RC building frame is analyzed to check the applicability of the developed framework and its improvement over current design approaches. The results show that the developed methodology framework can minimize the steel reinforcement area quickly and accurately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:15","2024-03-14 09:55:47","","39-57","","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 62</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\R63UF85D\Mangal and Cheng - 2018 - Automated optimization of steel reinforcement in R.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.01.013","Architectural design; Automated optimization; Automation; Building codes; Building Information Model - BIM; Building information modeling; Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concrete reinforcements; Concretes; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Reinforced concrete; Information theory; Structural optimization; Reinforced concrete design; Metal drawing; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Industry foundation classes; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Optimization framework; Steel reinforcement; Steel reinforcement bars; Steel reinforcements; Intelligent buildings; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Topology (rebar in the cross-section); 1_Size (rebar-diameter)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three different types of viscous damper design, which are classical, stair and X-diagonal model, are considered to prevent pounding on two adjacent building models. The objective function is minimized under the upper and lower limits of the damping coefficient of the damper and a target modal damping ratio. A new algorithm including time history analyses and numerical optimization methods is proposed to find the optimal dampers placement.

Similarly to a previous study which analysed real structures had observed that the unused mass of steel framed building could amount to nearly 46% of the total mass due to over-specification of the sections, we find a value of 36%. We observe that this value correlates with the design method, with software-aided design bringing significant improvements and with the design stage, where most of the optimisation seems to occur between the preliminary and tender stage. We find that neither the regularity of the structure nor the cost, independent of the measure used, correlate with the mean utilisation ratio (UR). Conversely, we observe an apparent reluctance to design beams above a 0.8 capacity UR. This reluctance explains most of the unused mass in buildings. The rest of unused mass consists in cores, trimmers and ties (6%), some of which bear loads not captured in this analysis but are otherwise necessary for stability reasons, and in edge secondary beams (3%) which design is constrained, and should not necessarily be considered as ‘unused’ mass. © 2018 The Author(s)","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:15","2024-02-20 10:40:59","","294-302","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 23</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\PSZHSFPU\Dunant et al. - 2018 - Regularity and optimisation practice in steel stru.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.01.009","Architectural design; design method; Optimisations; optimization; Shape optimization; Design; Structural design; building; Computer aided design; Article; carbon footprint; Optimisation; Steel construction; steel; Structural frames; structural component; Carbon footprint; Steel frame; cost; emission control; process optimization; Efficiency; Energy; methodology; mathematical model; structural design; Design practice; analytical model; engineering; Large amounts; Real structure; Regularity; Steel framed buildings; Steel frames; Steel structural; utilisation ratio; Utilization ratios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) is a promising energy-effective technique that can be used to reduce the cooling load of a livestock building in hot days. Several studies have been carried out to assess the feasibility of EAHE for tempering air in livestock buildings. However, no mathematical model serving for EAHE design for livestock buildings has been developed, in which the EAHE system is often operated continuously to keep animals comfortable and productive. This work firstly deduced a regression model for predicting the air temperature difference between an EAHE tube inlet and outlet (ΔTi-o) using response surface methodology (RSM) based on the data obtained from validated steady-state numerical simulations. Four key design and operation factors (tube diameter, tube length, air velocity, and the temperature difference between inlet air and the undisturbed soil) were incorporated into the model. Based on the regression model, a mathematical model for predicting the cooling capacity (CC) of an EAHE tube was obtained. Parametric analysis was conducted to reveal the effects of the four factors on both the ΔTi-o and the CC.

This paper presents a methodology in which the orthogonal and listing methods are integrated to predict a set of optimum PSS design variables to enhance the daylight availability in office buildings located in Seville, Spain. An orthogonal array was selected to perform a transverse comparison of the simulation factors mean effects and to find their statistical significance. Then, a standard level was fixed and used for further detailed analysis of a greater number of factor levels, measuring their daylighting contributions. The main advantage of the integrated method is the reduction of the number of simulations from 720 to 32, so the model could save considerable time and would help designers make early-design-stage decisions.

Automated architectural symmetry detection (ASD) from a data source is not only an intriguing inquiry in its own right, but also a step towards creation of semantically rich building and city information models with applications in architectural design, construction management, heritage conservation, and smart city development. While recent advances in sensing technologies provide inexpensive yet high-quality architectural 3D point clouds, existing methods of ASD from these data sources suffer several weaknesses including noise sensitivity, inaccuracy, and high computational loads. This paper aims to develop a novel derivative-free optimization (DFO)-based approach for effective ASD. It does so by firstly transforming ASD into a nonlinear optimization problem involving architectural regularity and topology. An in-house ODAS (Optimization-based Detection of Architectural Symmetries) approach is then developed to solve the formulated problem using a set of state-of-the-art DFO algorithms. Efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of ODAS are gauged from the experimental results on nine sets of real-life architectural 3D point clouds, with the computational time for ASD from 1.4 million points only 3.7 s and increasing in a sheer logarithmic order against the number of points. The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, formulating ASD as a nonlinear optimization problem constitutes a methodological innovation.

Next, the total installed cost is estimated based on unit rates maintained by suppliers on a secure web portal. Finally, the cost feedback is provided in the context of the 3-D model in near real-time.

In order to design and operate low energy buildings as well as to establish building energy codes and standards and effective energy policy, it is crucial to understand and quantify key factors influencing building energy performance. This study investigates air-conditioning (AC) energy use of four office buildings in four locations: Beijing, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Berkeley. Building simulation was employed to quantify the influences of key factors, including climate, building envelope and occupant behavior. Through simulation of various combinations of the three influencing elements, it is found that climate can lead to AC cooling consumption differences by almost two times, while occupant behavior resulted in the greatest differences (of up to three times) in AC cooling consumption. The influence of occupant behavior on AC energy consumption is not homogeneous. Under similar climates, when the occupant behavior in the building differed, the optimized building envelope design also differed. Overall, the optimal building envelope should be determined according to the climate as well as the occupants who use the building. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:16","2024-02-20 10:06:16","","344-352","","","169","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 28</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Office buildings; Energy use in buildings; Energy utilization; Low energy buildings; Air conditioning; Solar buildings; Building energy performance; Building envelopes; Building envelope; Energy consumption; Climate; Occupant behavior; Building envelope design; Technological choice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a minimum compliance optimization formulation, developed by other researchers, is applied to a framed-tube structure. The tube behavior is modeled as a cantilevered box beam. Independent variable in this problem is thickness of the box, and a formulation for its optimal value is proposed. The challenge in this research was treatment of the lower bound constraint on thickness in an analytical manner. To deal with this constraint, a critical height parameter is introduced, and the design domain is divided into two zones of constant thickness and constant curvature. This definition allows for computation of optimal thickness distribution along the structure through an analytic dimensionless equation. Most of the previously published papers in the field of tall structures are suitable for abstract analyses but not for design. In addition, most of them are computer-based. Considering these limitations, the current research presents a hand-calculation method for preliminary design, suitable for sensitivity analyses and parametric studies. As the presented formulations are dimensionless, they are applicable in any dimensional system. Different static loading patterns are considered; including the concentrated, uniform, triangular and quadratic forms.

On the one hand, inspiration can come from design strategies in terms of shapes and advanced cover materials, but this paper advocates that this can also pertain to the simulation-based design support tools that are used by building engineers.

Different plans were produced by utilizing the initial plan of the designer and changing some aspects of it approved by the architectural design using the parametric modeling technique. Utilizing similar logic and a shift in the arrangement of buildings on the site, a variety of options were produced.

This benchmark building is a steel frame, accounting for nonlinear response via material non-linearity (bi-linear hysteresis) concentrated at the ends of moment-resisting beam-column joints, and is designed for the SAC PhaseIIISteel Project. In order to illustrate the real-world implementable optimal design approach for designing an optimal tuned impact damper system attached to practical complex structures, a reduced-order data-driven physical model is developed by using the response data specifically from finite element model and the optimization-based parameter identification algorithm. The reduced-order model has been iteratively constructed to be consistent favorably with the finite element model on the aspects of both modal frequencies and mode shapes. Based on the reduced-order model, the optimal parameters of the tuned impact damper system are subsequently designed by adopting proposed performance indices and the differential evolution algorithm conveniently. The optimal vibration control effects are evaluated by using the original finite element model structure with the optimal tuned impact damper. Such optimal performance is also compared with that of the original finite element model with a conventionally designed tuned impact damper system. The results show that the optimal designed tuned impact damper system not only can significantly mitigate the peak and root mean square values of dynamic displacements, but also can reduce effectively the number of plastic hinges of the nonlinear benchmark structure compared with that with the conventional design. Furthermore, the performance-based optimal design can lead to a better robust performance of the tuned impact damper system in the cases of the main structure subjected to unknown earthquake excitations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:16","2024-03-25 11:07:42","","314-327","","","160","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 44</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\IK273H4C\Lu et al. - 2018 - Performance-based optimal design of tuned impact d.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.01.042","Architectural design; optimization; Shape optimization; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; algorithm; Benchmarking; building; Damping; Data reduction; Differential evolution algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; finite element method; Finite element method; Impact damper; Iterative methods; Structural optimization; structural response; Parameter estimation; Particle damper; Particle dampers; Passive control; performance assessment; Performance-based optimal design; Reduced order models; Reduced-order model; seismic response; Structural panels; Tuned impact damper; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 1_Others (damper); 3_Others (damper parameter); 7_Building_Component (TID)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such searches relied on experiences, expertise or gut feeling. In this paper, a new design method for the optimal building frame column design based on the genetic algorithm is proposed. First of all, in order to construct the optimal model of the building frame column, building units are divided into three categories in general: building bottom, main building and building roof. Secondly, the genetic algorithm is introduced to optimize the building frame column. In the meantime, a PGA-Skeleton based concurrent genetic algorithm design plan is proposed to improve the optimization efficiency of the genetic algorithm.

This system should provide thermal comfort to the building occupants at all time, meet the building owner's specific requirements, and have minimal investment, running, maintenance and replacement costs (i.e., the total cost) and energy use or environmental impact. Calculating these different aspects is highly time-consuming and the HVAC engineer will therefore only be able to compare a (very) limited number of alternatives leading to suboptimal designs. This study presents therefore a Python tool that automates the generation of all possible scenarios for given thermal power profiles and energy load and a given database of HVAC components. The tool sizes each scenario properly, computes its present total cost (PC) and the total CO2 emissions associated with the building energy use. Finally, the different scenarios can be searched and classified to pick the most appropriate scenario. The tool uses static calculations based on standards, manufacturer data and basic assumptions similar to those made by engineers in the early design phase. The current version of the tool is further focused on hybrid GEOTABS building, which combines a GEOthermal heat pump with a Thermally Activated System (TABS).

This paper presents a Unified Matrix Method, as an effective automated method that aids in the search for the best compromised spatial design of multi-story modular buildings during the early stages of the design process. The method is presented in a general format employing a balanced approach that integrates different design aspects together, namely constructional, architectural and structural aspects. First, it describes how the spatial design of multi-story modular buildings can be generally represented by three-dimensional matrices arisen from combinatorial problems. Then, the spatial design is modeled by a design structure matrix, which decomposes the building into smaller components such as modular units, connections, stabilizing and bracing systems. Finally, a three-dimensional assignment problem is formulated to solve the problem. Particular conditions or preferences for the spatial design can be incorporated as constraints on the assignment problem. In order to show the robustness of the method, an actual case study is designed and employed, with the aim of obtaining a spatial design having minimum construction cost, maximum plan regularity and maximum energy efficient form. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:06:17","","31-42","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 72</p>","","","Architectural design; Automation; Buildings; Form finding; Design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Automated design; Problem solving; Product design; Spatial design; Modular construction; Combinatorial optimization; Assignment problem; Assignment problems; Design Structure Matrices; Design structure matrix; Modular buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a framework that (i) incorporates the behaviour of building systems (e.g., heating system and building envelope) to account for the interdependencies amongst the building systems, and (ii) evaluates the design of building systems in order to reduce their lifecycle cost and environmental impact. The proposed framework utilizes the failure model (i.e., the survivor function and Mean Time To Failure) of Reliability theory to model the behaviour of building systems during operations and measures the performance of these systems (i.e., assessing the time to failure) and multi-objective optimization to find the design alternative that reduces the impact of the assessment criteria and increase the performance of building systems as per the failure model. A case study is also presented in this paper in order to illustrate the application of the proposed framework during the design. The case study shows that the application of the proposed framework contributes to reducing the lifecycle negative impact of building systems on cost, fossil fuel consumption, Global Warming Potential, acidifications potentials, human health criteria, eutrophication potential, Ozon depletion potential, and smog potential, while increasing the lifespan (i.e. the selected performance measure) of the heating systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:28:11","","388-402","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 14</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2019.02.010","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Construction; Energy efficiency; Ecodesign; Cost reduction; Construction industry; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; Environmental impact; Performance of buildings; Heating equipment; Sustainable construction; Global warming; Global warming potential; Building systems technical performance; Design assessment; Design assessments; Environmental responsibility; Eutrophication; Eutrophication potentials; Fossil fuels; Multi-criteria assessment; Reliability theory; Technical performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distributed energy systems such as energy hubs offer promising solutions in this context. Evaluating the energy demand at urban scale is vital to support the design of energy hubs. However, most of the recent studies are based on bottom-up models and do not consider the energy demand in detail. More specifically, the influence of the urban climate on urban energy demand has not been considered so far in the energy system design process. In order to address this research gap, a novel computational platform is developed in the first part of this study, combining an urban climate model with a building simulation tool and an energy system optimization model. The second part of the manuscript is devoted to quantifying the impact of urban climate on energy system design and assessing the consequences of neglecting this specific aspect on energy system performance. Three case studies are conducted considering three building densities for the city of Nablus (building density at the periphery, center and future center of the city) in Palestine. Three scenarios representing (1) standalone buildings (present practice) (2) shadowing and longwave reflection (radiation heat transfer from the walls and the roofs of the buildings to the urban climate and to the sky) of neighboring buildings and (3) urban climate are considered for each case study when computing the energy demand. Subsequently, the energy system is optimized considering Net Present Value (NPV) and system autonomy level as the objective functions (Pareto optimization). The results of the study reveal that the urban climate has a notable impact on the energy demand and energy system design. More importantly, it is shown that the influence of urban climate results in higher fluctuations in the energy demand, which in turn results in a notable increase in the NPV (by up to 40%). This further magnifies the increase in annual or peak demand. The study reveals that neglecting the influence of urban climate in the energy system design process can result in a performance gap in NPV, grid integration level, and greenhouse gas emissions and can impose reliability issues. The design tool introduced in this study can be used for urban planning to mitigate the aforementioned adverse effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:40:53","","847-860","","","222","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 86</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.004","Architectural design; design method; optimization; Structural design; building; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Computational methods; Multiobjective optimization; performance assessment; Systems analysis; Heat transfer; Pareto principle; Global warming; Energy hub; Energy hubs; Urban planning; Climate models; simulation; alternative energy; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; renewable resource; Building simulation; urban planning; Energy demands; Fossil fuels; quantitative analysis; Energy system design; greenhouse gas; fossil fuel; climate modeling; Energy system optimization; Energy system optimizations; Performance gap; Performance gaps; System design process; The net present value (NPV); Urban climate; Urban climates; Urban energy systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novelty of the procedure includes three aspects. Firstly, the modal acceleration responses of buildings are employed to evaluate the occupant comfort in the building instead of the commonly used total acceleration responses. This enhances the applicability of the proposed method and reduces the computation error by including the effect of the reoccurrence period of wind and avoiding calculation of the peak factor of response. Secondly, because the current method such as the modified Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler (HLRF) algorithm is not suitable to the optimization design considering multiple wind directions, to overcome this problem, the design point method in generalized random space (DPG method) is used to establish equations of reliability for converting modal acceleration constraints to natural frequency constraints, in which an approach of mapping transformation is used to treat the non-normal variables. Thirdly, by improving the method of determining the limit of the wind speed based on the joint distribution of the wind speed and direction, the failure probabilities of modal accelerations under all wind directions are combined based on the joint probability distribution of the wind speed and direction to obtain the limit of natural frequency constraints. The parameters of the joint probability distribution are determined from the meteorological observation data of the wind speed. In association with the Optimality Criterion (OC) algorithm, the proposed method is applied in the wind resistant optimization of a 60-stories standard model of Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC). The investigations show that the proposed method can effectively decrease the structural total weight subject to reliability frequency constraints, displacement constraints and inter-story drift constrains. Considering the randomness of parameters and joint distribution of the wind speed and direction in the comfort constraint could enhance the design space for the structural total weight. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-03-21 13:41:04","","460-471","","","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 28</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\7B6N3XI6\Fu et al. - 2018 - Design optimization on high-rise buildings conside.pdf","","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a fact, the shapes and locations of building exteriors as well as their surrounding obstacles highly impact the power output of distributed PV systems. Since they are complex and correlated in nature, these environmental factors have not been precisely dealt with so far in the current manual design practice. Actually, it is evident that if in the design stage these factors can be fully taken into account, the power output versus investment would be largely enhanced. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic distributed PV system design tool, which fully utilizes and integrates the existing information and modeling techniques, i.e. information from Building Information Model (BIM), as well as advanced optimization methods, to facilitate precise PV system simulation and optimization. The proposed tool firstly makes the detailed shade and radiation analysis on the basis of the existing BIM model, and, according to these results, executes an automatic PV design process oriented by the goal of the minimal cost-to-power ratio. Afterwards, a coordinate transform mechanism is designed to automatically transfer the calculated PV design into the BIM model, which facilitates the realization of automatic deployment. This tool has been applied to a roof PV project and verified via both numerical and empirical studies. Results show that compared to human-based design, this tool can improve up to 265% design efficiency, increase 36.1% power output and reduce around 4.5% capital investment per unit power output. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:06:17","","13-22","","","150","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 33</p>","","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Information theory; Carbon footprint; Investments; Automatic deployments; Building Information Model (BIM); Co-ordinate transform; Coordination transformation; Cost-to-power ratio; Distributed PV design; Environmental factors; Power ratio; Radiation analysis; Surrounding obstacles; Thermoelectric power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New paradigms are emerging both for new and existing buildings (e.g. NZEBs) and passive design strategies are becoming increasingly common. However, the adoption of these strategies in mild climates has to be carefully evaluated to prevent overheating in intermediate seasons and increasing cooling loads in summer, considering also climate change scenarios. Additionally, optimistic assumptions about building technology performance are often considered and the variability of occupant comfort preferences and behaviour is generally neglected in the design phase. The research presented aims at verifying the suitability of a simple, robust and scalable calibration approach (based on multivariate linear regression) to link design and operational performance analysis transparently, using a Passive House case study building. First, the original baseline design configuration is compared with a larger spectrum of data generated by means of parametric simulation, following a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach. After that, regression models are trained first on simulation data and then progressively calibrated on measured data during a three year monitoring period. The two fundamental objectives are evaluating the robustness of design phase performance analysis through parametric simulation (i.e. detecting potentially critical assumptions) and maintaining a continuity with operation phase performance analysis (i.e. exploiting the feed-back from measured data). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:06:17","","26-40","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 50</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; building; regression analysis; Regression analysis; performance assessment; Building performance simulations; climate change; Houses; cooling; simulation; parameter estimation; Parametric modelling; Climate change; Passive house; Passive House; Design of experiments; calibration; modeling; Building performance simulation; Behavioural modelling; Multivariate regression; operations technology; Performance monitoring; technology adoption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:17","2024-02-20 10:30:57","","1189-1205","","","158","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 102</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.11.017","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Building information modeling; Buildings; Design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Information theory; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Embodied energy; Energy conservation; Operational energy; Life cycle energies; Housing; Zero energy buildings; Life cycle energy; Trade off; Trade-off","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A prototype office building model with a curtain wall design is first constructed in EnergyPlus to compare the heat gain, heat loss, thermal load, lighting energy and PV generation for different curtain walls. The comparative analysis proves the excellent thermal insulating performance of VPV IGU, which can reduce up to 81.63% and 75.03% of the heat gain as well as 31.94% and 32.03% of the heat loss in Hong Kong (HK) and Harbin (HB) respectively. With the application of VPV IGU in all available facades of the prototype building, net energy savings of 37.79% and 39.82% can be achieved in diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, screening and variance based sensitivity analyses are conducted to prioritize building integrated photovoltaic design parameters with respect to specific weather conditions. The selected important design parameters are then optimized with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), by which the optimum building design can achieve a net energy consumption reduction of 48.72% and 60.80% compared to benchmarking designs in Hong Kong and Harbin. Such an integrated design optimization can successfully improve computation efficiency with an acceptable solution accuracy, and assist the incorporation of PV envelop systems with passive architectural designs.

The minimization of temperature alteration allows for efficient energy use and improvement of indoor thermal environment. Unlike the classical reactive control, MPC is able to act in advance and to explicitly handle constraints on building variables when selecting the best scenario. This peculiarity makes MPC particularly suitable for the optimal energy management of buildings but, despite the increasing research activity in the field, the commercial technologies are lagging behind. Among the reasons are the lack of a well established design approach easily applicable to the buildings domain and the lack of a design optimization. In this paper a tuning methodology of MPC design for energy efficient building thermal control is presented. The tuning is performed on the controller parameters, and aims at identifying the best parameter set in terms of energy saving and temperature deviation from the chosen setpoint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, a simulation based analysis using a model estimated on a real case study is presented.

Concerning the cooling season, the approach implies set of environmental analyses focused on twofold assessments: (i) the use of renewable energy sources for active and passive strategies, (ii) the impact on outdoor thermal comfort of the technological solutions and cool materials installed on the buildings’ facades. From the definition of the local boundary conditions, preliminary climate analyses were conducted with dynamic simulation tools such as Ladybug and DIVA-for-Rhino, while numerical and computational fluid dynamic models, such as ENVI-met and OpenFOAM, were used to carry out microclimate and wind flow analyses. The approach is tested on two existing residential building blocks in a case study district in Bolzano (Italy). The assessment of several design interventions and building technological solutions have been studied: from the (i) addition of one-story volume on the existing buildings, to the (ii) creation of new green areas, and the (iii) installation of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), vertical greenery and double skin façade (DSF) systems on the building's façades. The results, divided into practice and policy implications, demonstrate that preliminary analyses play a relevant role to assess the exploitation of renewable energy sources to optimize the use of urban and building surfaces since the early design phases. High-albedo materials on the façades can counterbalance the loss of solar potential due to the overshadowing effect of the additional story. The combination of cool materials (e.g., white reflective plaster) and the increment of the buildings’ height could reduce by about 1°C the thermal discomfort registered during the high thermal peak during the day. Solar and urban airflow analyses allow optimizing the integration of BIPV in a DSF system; while the installation of green façade can reduce the air temperature locally by up to about 0.5°C. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:18","2024-02-20 10:06:18","","235-256","","","175","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 23</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Climate models; Computational fluid dynamics; Renewable energy resources; Atmospheric temperature; Building integrated photovoltaic; Design interventions; Dynamic simulation tool; Existing residential buildings; Microclimate; Natural resources; Plaster; Public policy; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy sources; Solar potential; Urban airflow; Use of renewable energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper addresses this common limitation offering an integrated sustainable structural analysis at building level. To achieve this, a BIM-embedded approach was established utilising embodied carbon metrics and results from heuristic structural optimisation. A real building scenario was used to test the proposed approach in the context of multi-storey reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Results show how the building life cycle performance is affected by the use of structurally optimised designs. The structural floors in particular, not only cover the largest proportion of the embodied carbon in the structure but they are also responsible for a large proportion of the carbon emissions of the tested building elements. The results obtained in this paper justified the need for more comprehensive efforts in the design optimisation of RC floors. Overall, it is suggested that the unclear interpretation of the optimisation outputs would result in the selection of structural designs that could compromise the buildings carbon performance. © 2018 The Authors","2018","2024-02-20 10:06:18","2024-03-19 08:45:36","","587-600","","","173","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 69</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\ESH8GZJV\Eleftheriadis et al. - 2018 - BIM-embedded life cycle carbon assessment of RC bu.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.05.042","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Floors; Optimisations; Shape optimization; Structural design; Life cycle; Design alternatives; Optimisation; Reinforced concrete; RC structure; Structural optimization; Structural optimisation; Environmental impact; RC structures; Design optimisation; Building life cycle; LCA; Carbon performance; Environmental impacts; 3_Carbon; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 1_Topology (number of bays)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major determinant of the sustainability of the design of a building is its fenestrations. The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of designing and locating windows on building facades such that a number of relevant criteria to the MENA region are optimised, including solar heat gain, privacy, daylighting and cost of installation. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-objective optimisation problem is proposed with the focus on capturing the requirements of residential dwellings in the MENA region. Since the problem contains conflicting objectives that need to be optimised, a lexicographic approach is adopted. In order to display the Pareto curve, a bi-objective analysis based on the ε-constraint method is utilised. Findings: The conflicting nature of the proposed problem is indicated via the Pareto optimal solutions yielded. Depending on the preference of criteria adopted in lexicographic optimisation, the location of the windows on the building façade tends to change. The bi-objective analysis indicates the importance of balancing out the daylight factor against each of privacy, solar heat gain and installation cost criteria. Furthermore, an analysis conducted in three major cities in the MENA region highlights the discrepancy in design alternatives generated depending on the local climatic condition. Originality/value: This work proposes a novel mathematical optimisation model which focuses on producing a sustainable design and layout for windows on the facades of residential dwellings located in the MENA region. The proposed model provides designers with guidance through an automated support tool that yields optimised window designs and layout to ensure the sustainability of their designed buildings. © 2018, Ahmed Hammad, Ali Akbarnezhad, Hanna Grzybowska, Peng Wu and Xiangyu Wang.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:18","2024-02-20 10:06:18","","117-137","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; design; building; Energy efficiency; Multi objective; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; structural component; Integer programming; Mathematical optimizations; Location; Pareto principle; Mathematical optimization; Housing; Solar heating; numerical method; Curve fitting; Passive solar; Window design; Window designs; Multi-objective; Building facades; Middle East and North Africa; Mixed integer programming; Mixed-Integer Programming; Pareto curve; Residential dwelling; Solar heat gains; Window location","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide the required planning flexibility with world-class spectator and user amenity, the AMV has a large column-free arena with an elliptical footprint. The arena roof clear spans up to 118 m between inclined perimeter supports, making it one of the largest clear-span roofs in Australia. The roof is gently curved in two directions, and the resulting saddle shape combined with the inclined perimeter walls creates a striking and memorable building, befitting the important role that the venue will play in 2018 and beyond. The building was successfully delivered quickly and to a tight budget, in large part due to the efficiency of the design of the steel roof and wall structure, and to the adoption of a ‘construction-led’ design approach. This approach ensured that the steel roof structure could be economically, safely and quickly fabricated and erected in parallel with the construction of the concrete substructure and bowl.

BIM can be regarded as both a digital representation of a building and a store of data with which to facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information throughout the lifecycle of a structure. Buildings sustain economic losses during their lifecycle due to ordinary maintenance operations and unpredictable events. These events reduce the structural performance of a building and highlight the need for financial investment. The costs of maintenance operations are usually accurately defined, but other expenditure is not as easy to evaluate when events are uncertain. A lifecycle cost (LCC) analysis of buildings exposed to seismic risk is a critical issue in structural engineering. Expected losses, including initial and post-earthquake repair costs, are an important parameter in structural design. Herein, a simplified method based on a semi-probabilistic approach is implemented in a BIM model to evaluate the economic performance, and economic losses, of a building exposed to seismic risk. A BIM procedure is implemented in a case study to improve the feasibility of this process and to deal with the large amount of data concerning the damage to and cost analysis of the components that constitute the facility. Furthermore, this specific BIM tool for the economic loss assessment has been embraced in a wider methodology aimed at optimizing the seismic retrofit strategy, taking into account both safety and economic features. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2024-02-20 10:06:18","2024-02-20 10:31:47","","90-101","","","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 55</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.10.023","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural analysis; Life cycle; Construction; Building Information Modelling; Risk assessment; Structural performance; Earthquake engineering; Seismology; Uncertainty analysis; Retrofitting; Cost engineering; Digital representations; Exchange of information; Financial investments; Functional characteristics; Losses; Maintenance operations; Probabilistic approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the process of calculating the proper formwork design is lengthy and complex, the responsibility is usually left to a field manager/engineer which may not have enough time and resources identifying all possible options to select the most effective formwork. The design aspects that go into formwork include several parameters such as concrete pressure, bending, deflection, and horizontal shearing. Even though there are equations and calculations for each of those parameters in the design of concrete formwork, the process of performing the calculations for each concrete formwork application is still lengthy. Therefore, construction managers often rely on their previous work experiences and apply similar formwork designs for most situations. By developing a BIM (Building Information Modeling) based automatic formwork design system, this research aims to optimize the formwork design process required to perform the calculations for the design of the formwork by automatically extracting the properties and data from a BIM model.

Especially for building retrofit many assumptions on construction, material etc. have to be taken, which increases the uncertainty of simulation results. In conjunction with simulation, methods of Building Performance Optimization are increasingly employed.

This paper presents a comprehensive study on the techno-economic performance of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-wind-battery system for an office building located in Tehran, Iran. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables model was used to investigate the optimal design options and the techno-economic viability of the hybrid renewable energy system installed in that building. The proposed hybrid system based on renewable resources was designed to electrify the restrooms of the building. An optimal system configuration was chosen based on the total net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). The simulation results demonstrated that the optimum structure for the hybrid system for the primary load demand of 5.6 kW h per day, consists of 3 kW PV modules, 1 kW wind turbine, 1 kW inverter, and sixteen 200 A h batteries. The total NPC of such a system was estimated to be 21 132, while the COE was 1.543 per kW h. In addition, the proposed hybrid energy system could provide 2733 kW h additional electricity to the office building. Furthermore, in the last part of this research, a sensitivity analysis for different parameters such as primary load, wind speed, global solar radiation, interest rate, total NPC, cost of electricity, number of batteries and total electrical production was performed to demonstrate and elaborate the effect of each decision variable on the configuration of the optimum hybrid system. It became clear that two hybrid system configurations, i.e., PV-Wind-Battery and PV-Battery systems, are suggested as the most economical and feasible alternatives and have wide range of usage for different load demand values. Additionally based on the change in the initial design parameters such as wind speed, global solar radiation, load demand, and the real interest rate, a comparison between these two hybrid systems in terms of the total NPC, COE, electrical production, excess electricity, and grid extension distance has been made to investigate the effect of each decision variable on the optimal combination and the techno-economic viability of the hybrid renewable energy system. ï¿½ 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:19","2024-02-20 10:40:09","","","","5","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 31</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4934659","Architectural design; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Optimal systems; Structural design; Optimization; Costs; Decision making; Office buildings; Structural optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Wind; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic cells; Solar radiation; Renewable energy resources; Electric batteries; Cost of electricity; Feasible alternatives; Global solar radiation; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Hybrid systems; Optimal system configuration; Wind turbines; Wind-battery systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantitative data on building energy performance as a function of urban density, building compactness and orientation, building use and supply options are rarely available during the design of new cities or early scenario analysis for existing city quarters, making it difficult for cities to effectively evaluate which concepts work today and in the future. The paper proposes a methodology to assess the energy demand and supply options as a function of the availability of geometry, building standard and use data. An automated procedure was implemented to identify each building's geometry and volume and transfer the information to a simulation tool, which then calculates heating demand and solar energy generation on roofs and facades. The simulation includes shading calculations for each segment of the façades and roofs and thus allows a very detailed quantification of the building energy demand.By applying the methodology to a case study city quarter designed in an urban competition in Munich, it could be shown how the urban design influences the energy demand of the quarter and which fractions of renewable energy can be integrated into the roofs. While the building insulation standard and use are the is most important criteria for building energy efficiency (with an impact of more than a factor 2), the exact geometrical form, compactness and urban shading effects influences the energy demand by 10-20%. On the other hand, the detailed roof geometry and orientation influences the possible solar coverage of electricity or thermal needs. Zero energy city quarters with solar resources alone are only possible when all available building surface areas are fully optimized and do not need to fulfill other requirements such as providing roof gardens, terraces or others. Combinations with other more centralized renewable resources such as deep geothermal, solar or biomass heat or cogeneration plants are often necessary to achieve zero energy balances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:19","2024-02-20 10:06:19","","323-333","","","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 43</p>","","","Architectural design; Building codes; Buildings; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Geometry; Roofs; Automated procedures; Building energy efficiency; Building energy performance; Geothermal energy; Urban planning; Urban growth; energy efficiency; simulation; Germany; roof; solar power; urban planning; 3D city modeling; automation; Bavaria; Building insulations; Cogeneration plants; Energy assessment; Energy assessment tools; Energy performance assessments; energy planning; energy policy; Munich; Planning competitions; Solar energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, whereas the collectivity pursues the minimization of environmental impact, the private pursues the maximization of financial viability. Solving such trade-off design problems usually involves a big computational cost for exploring a huge solution domain including a large number of design options. To reduce that computational cost, a bi-objective simulation-based optimization algorithm, developed in a previous study, is applied in the present investigation. The algorithm is implemented for minimizing the CO2-eq emissions and the discounted payback time (DPB) of a single-family house in cold climate, where 13,456 design solutions including building envelope and heating system options are explored and compared to a predefined reference case. The whole building life is considered by assuming a calculation period of 30 years. The results show that the type of heating system significantly affects energy performance; notably, the ground source heat pump leads to the highest reduction in CO2-eq emissions, around 1300 kgCO2-eq/m2, with 17 year DPB; the oil fire boiler can provide the lowest DPB, equal to 8.5 years, with 850 kgCO2-eq/m2 reduction. In addition, it is shown that using too high levels of thermal insulation is not an effective solution as it causes unacceptable levels of summertime overheating. Finally a multi-objective decision making approach is proposed in order to enable the stakeholders to choice among the optimal solutions according to the weight given to each objective, and thus to each perspective.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:19","2024-02-20 10:06:19","","","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","","","Architectural design; Low-carbon buildings; Low-Carbon Buildings; Structural design; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Building performance simulations; Environmental impact; Heating equipment; Heating; Solar buildings; Building envelopes; Building envelope; Thermal insulation; Geothermal heat pumps; Building performance simulation; Pareto front; Energy design; Heating system; Heating systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparison of these two methods resulted in a percent difference less than 1% which demonstrates the reliability of using the model-based method for designing critical construction components. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:20","2024-02-20 10:37:56","","33-44","","","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 27</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2016.12.001","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Structural design; Construction; Information theory; Robotics; Manufacture; Building information model; Kinematics; Chains; Dimensional problems; Dimensional variability; Dimensional variations; Discrepancy and deviation; Fits and tolerances; Kinematics chains; Laser scanning; Manufacturing industries; Modern methods of constructions; Tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of simulations conducted on a total of 384 combinations of HVAC system and alternative building models, the correlation between building cooling-to-heating load ratio and HVAC system energy consumption was analyzed. The diverse and total cooling and heating system efficiency of HVAC systems was derived. It was found that the ratio of the efficiencies of heating and cooling systems affected the optimum building design, hence the active and passive parts of a building should be considered simultaneously in a coupled way for the optimum design for the energy-efficient buildings. Energy consumption tends to vary radically with the type of HVAC system, even under identical building load conditions. That is, with different cooling-to-heating load ratio but a similar total energy, the total primary energy consumption and the cooling-to-heating energy ratio are predicted to change depending on the selected HVAC system. It is expected that a design plan formulated using the method and system efficiency enable a bi-directional energy optimization process conducive to providing feedback and prove to be of great use in building design factors, HVAC system solution, and decision-making at the initial design stage that considers building thermal load characteristics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a pilot test, this study proposes a systematic method to develop a model, which can immediately assess the annual electricity consumption for office buildings with fan coil system in Shanghai. First, a base-case building model is established by EnergyPlus to create a pool of candidate inputs using orthogonal experiment design. Then, analysis of variance is used to identify a total of 10 key building design parameters, which are selected as the input variables in the support vector regression (SVR) model based on a well-structured database. The performance of SVR is optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) based on radial basis function kernel. Finally, two real office buildings in Shanghai with reliable measured data serve to evaluate the developed hybrid model. The resulting differences between the predicted and measured values are generally within 10%.

As operational energy consumption in buildings falls, due to continued tightening of regulations and improvements in the efficiency of energy generation and distribution, present inefficiencies in embodied energy use become increasingly significant in the calculation of whole life energy use. The status quo cannot continue if we are to meet carbon emissions reduction targets. We must now tackle embodied energy as vigorously as we have tackled operational energy in buildings in the past. Current design methods are poorly suited to controlling material inefficiency in design, which arises as a risk mitigation strategy against unknown loads and uncertain human responses to these loads. Prescriptive codes are intended to result in buildings capable of providing certain levels of performance. These performance levels are often based on small tests, and the actual performance of individual building designs is rarely fully assessed after construction. A new approach is required to drive the minimisation of embodied energy (lightweighting) through the collection of performance data on both structures and their occupants. This paper uses an industry facing survey to explore for the first time the potential use of performance measurement to create new drivers for lighter and more usable designs. The use of ubiquitous structural, human, and environmental sensing, combined with automated data fusion, data interpretation, and knowledge generation is now required to ensure that future generations of building designs are lightweight, lower-carbon, cheaper, and healthier. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:20","2024-02-20 10:35:02","","61-67","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.085","Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon; Design; Structural design; Life cycle; Emission control; Performance-based design; Energy utilization; Whole life cycles; Digital storage; Performance based design; Built environment; Carbon emissions reductions; Data fusion; Environmental sensing; Knowledge generations; Performance measurements; Risk mitigation strategy; Whole life cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emergence of Semantic Web technologies provides more opportunities to assist structural engineers in improving building sustainability. The study presented in this paper investigates how ontology and Semantic Web rules can be used in a knowledge-based system, to represent information about structural design and sustainability, and to facilitate decision-making in design process by recommending appropriate solutions for different use cases. A prototypical system named OntoSCS (Ontology for Sustainable Concrete Structure), including a Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology as knowledge base and SWRL rules providing reasoning mechanism, is developed to offer optimised structural design solutions and selections of material suppliers.

The goal is to combine current parametric modeling, digital fabrication, and computer graphics techniques to automatically generate the geometric input of an energy model from any digital 3D model of a building. Such automation facilitates the use and implementation of goal-oriented design methods that integrate energy performance with other types of building performance models. In this work, mesh planarization algorithms, which are currently used in computer graphics and in digital fabrication methods, are used and adapted to automate and optimize the parsing of non-planar surfaces to EnergyPlus (E+), a popular BEM engine. The proposed methodology facilitates the modeling of thermal zones with double-curved envelopes, which is a time-consuming task that typically requires a high level of expertise from the energy modeler. The proposed single, streamlined workflow generates digital models that are suitable for both energy optimization and digital fabrication, thereby facilitating the integration of two parallel design procedures at the core of an architectural design process. Through this workflow, a single CAD model generates solutions that are energy efficient and feasibly fabricated using digital techniques.

The optimal design parameters of the TMDs, i.e. damping and frequency ratios, were determined by using a genetic algorithm on a simplified model of the reference structure, composed by seven masses each representing one storey. The optimal solutions for the TMDs were then applied to a detailed finite element model of the seven-storey building, where the timber panels were modelled with shell elements and the steel connectors with linear spring. By comparing the numerical results of the building with and without multiple TMDs, the improvement in seismic response was assessed. Dynamic time-history analyses were carried out for a set of seven natural records, selected in accordance with Eurocode 8, on the simplified model, and for Kobe earthquake ground motion on the detailed model. Results in terms of acceleration reduction for different TMD configurations show that the behaviour of the seven-storey timber building can be significantly improved, especially at the upper storeys.

This article presents research results on the relation between the morphology of a building and its energy efficiency. Three types of residential buildings are analyzed: the single-family detached house, semidetached house and multidwelling building. The cases studied modeled in EnergyPlus to obtain building energy consumption per useful built surface. Also considered is the energy produced, thanks to the installation of photovoltaic solar panels on the building roof and on 50 % of the south façade surface. The paper provides a method to obtain the curve that shows the difference between the energy demand of residential buildings for various uses (HVAC, lighting, etc.) and the energy generated by installed solar panels in the building. The results reveal that the single-family detached housing model is the less energy-efficient. In the case of multidwelling houses, the optimal building height is obtained to reduce building energy consumption depending on total useful built area. The results show that up to 25 % of multidwelling building energy demand can be satisfied by solar energy on the rooftop and the façade. The balance between the energy demand and energy production of the building highlights the dimensional parameters that define optimal building shape from an energy efficiency perspective. The results obtained can be usefully applied to estimate the optimal geometric characteristics for a building of the same total surface area, which maximally reduces the final energy demand. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:21","2024-02-20 10:06:21","","65-84","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Geometry; Energy utilization; Building energy simulations; HVAC; Building energy performance; Houses; Solar power generation; Building shape; Building energy simulation; Solar energy; Building efficient design; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV); Efficient designs; HVAC demand; Morphology; Residential energy model; Residential energy models; Solar cell arrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of the case study showed that the total weight was decreased by 18.1% and the equivalent static wind loading (ESWL) in across-wind direction was reduced by 9.03% after the design optimization, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimal design method. © 2016","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:21","2024-03-26 10:36:56","","197-207","","","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\LBP5RJTG\Li and Li - 2016 - Wind-induced response based optimal design of irre.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2016.06.001","Architectural design; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Optimality criteria method; Optimality Criteria Method; Structural design; Tall buildings; Tunnels; Wind load; Wind loads; Wind stress; Wind tunnel test; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels; Wind-induced response; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a shear-wall-based building, the conventional design process starts with an architect generating a floor plan, which is then passed to a structural engineer, who, based on knowledge and prior experience, tries to place shear walls to balance conflicting requirements: minimum structural weight, satisfactory structural strength and serviceability, conformity to architectural layout. This design process can be slow and inefficient, requiring a trial-and-error approach that is unlikely to lead to the best solution. The work presented in this paper intends to accelerate the process with an optimization system involving a ground structure program formulation, a modified evolutionary algorithm, and innovative computational techniques. Unlike existing work that focuses either exclusively on structural performance or architectural layout, this research integrates both. An efficient computational design methodology for shear wall layout in plan is introduced. The method minimizes structural weight with constraints on torsion, flexural strength, shear strength, drift, and openings and accessibility. It can be applied from the very beginning of floor plan design or after generating an architectural floor plan. This paper demonstrates the potential of this approach through a variety of case studies. Key contributions include a novel application of the ground structure method, a fast and robust modified evolutionary algorithm, and a simplified auto-calculation system for reinforced concrete design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:21","2024-03-25 12:15:00","","225-240","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 45</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GSLCWF4N\Zhang and Mueller - 2017 - Shear wall layout optimization for conceptual desi.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.02.059","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Topology (interesting); 7_Part of building (Shear walls)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multi-criteria approach has been developed to validate and optimize the influence of passive spaces on sustainable buildings from the perspectives of building environment quality and occupant satisfaction. Building environment quality was judged by fieldwork physical environment tests, including indoor thermal, lighting, indoor air quality and acoustics data in the operating phase. A voting method designed to test satisfaction was developed to evaluate the occupants' satisfaction with the building's overall environment and space efficiency. Considering both the relationship between the building and people, and the building and the environment, from the dual perspectives of building design and building environment control, a comprehensive judgment model for a Comfort - Satisfaction Matrix was developed to display the regulation capacity of the building's environmental performance in the passive space. Finally, an in-depth fieldwork survey of six types of passive courtyard spaces in cold climates was conducted as an example to validate the developed multi-criteria approach.

The required objective of building energy performance can be achieved by limiting extra cost, integrating building design, and using the most appropriate and readily available materials. However, standard computations, such as the French building energy code used here, require vocational expertise that involves managing separate processes and numerous design variables. The design is therefore restricted to well-known techniques, especially for small constructions. In this paper, the usual stakeholder constraints and possible developments in design practice are considered through the use of real product databases and vocational tools to calculate construction costs. In the first stage, which takes into account cost and energy demand, an integrated approach to building envelope design is detailed, including a semantic system to automate the process. Then an optimization method (a genetic algorithm) is proposed to assess energy performance and the cost of the building envelope. This process is illustrated as a case study for a single family house.

In this work, a method to determine probabilistic design summer years will be presented. These years take into account the return periods of actual events, are presented within a probabilistic framework and therefore include a description of the severity of the year at each location. Practical application: Design summer years are designed to be used to optimise building performance in terms of thermal comfort at design stage. This paper demonstrates a method to create probabilistic design summer years which contain a range of overheating events which can be used to inform designers of the overheating risk to occupants. The proposed method is then used to generate new near extreme weather files for the UK. © SAGE Publications.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:22","2024-02-20 10:06:22","","503-522","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 33</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\G7TIY3KN\Eames - 2016 - An update of the UK's design summer years Probabi.pdf","","Architectural design; Buildings; Design; Structural design; Building performance; Risk assessment; Early design stages; Meteorology; Weather data; Building Thermal models; Design summer year; Design summer years; Probabilistic design; Probabilistic framework; return periods; Return periods; Risk analysis; weather data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can only be achieved when project team adopt the use of a strategic approach while selecting the materials, although this could be a complex task for decision makers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers designers the ability to assess different design alternatives at the conceptual stage of a project. As a method of integration and through its modeling techniques, BIM can be used to assess the impacts of design alternatives on the energy saving of buildings all over their life. Furthermore, BIM has the potential to help designers select the right type of materials during the early design stage, and make vital decisions when selecting the materials that have sustainable impact on the building's life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to propose a methodology that integrates BIM with decision-making problem-solving approaches (i.e. Entropy-TOPSIS) in order to efficiently optimize the selection of sustainable building components at the conceptual design stage of building projects. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is developed by using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to aid the design team decide on and select the optimum type of sustainable building components and design families while doing conceptual design of proposed projects, based on three main criteria (i.e. environmental factors, economic factors-""cost efficiency,"" and social well-being) in an attempt to identify the influence of design variations on the whole building's sustainable performance. The multi-criteria procedure embedded in the DSS relies on numerical models to simulate alternative situations, as well as ranking the alternatives and select the best ones based on both the owners' strategic preferences and the availability of sustainable materials in the market. The set of models included in the DSS describes the relationship between sustainability criteria, manufacturers' sustainable materials and the interactions between project team that take place during the design of sustainable building projects. This paper aims at exposing the feasibility of using BIM for analysing the life cycle costs of sustainable buildings at the conceptual stage. The design alternatives suggested by the DSS are evaluated in an integrated environment that joins BIM concept and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method to analyze the operational cost of the whole building. An actual building project is used to validate the workability and capability of the proposed methodology. © 2015 The author.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:22","2024-02-20 10:06:22","","399-420","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 55</p>","","","Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Buildings; Design; Structural design; Conceptual design; Life cycle; Costs; Life cycle costs (LCC); Decision making; Ecodesign; Information theory; Sustainable development; BIM; Decision support systems; Artificial intelligence; Energy conservation; Sustainable design; Conceptual design stages; Intelligent buildings; Problem solving; Availability; Green building; Green buildings; Building components; Decision support system (dss); Decision support system (DSS); Decision-making problem; Life cycle cost (LCC); Multiple criteria decision making; Strategic materials; Sustainability criteria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the practical design of green building envelopes for energy conservation is a highly complex optimization problem, and architects must make multiobjective decisions. In practice, methods such as multicriteria analyses that entail capitalizing on possibly many (but in nearly any case limited) alternatives are commonly employed. This study investigated the feasibility of applying a multiobjective optimal model on building envelope design (MOPBEM), which involved integrating a building envelope energy performance model with a multiobjective optimizer. The MOPBEM was established to provide a reference for green designs. A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to achieve a tradeoff design set between three conflicting objectives, namely minimizing the envelope construction cost (ENVCOST), minimizing the envelope energy performance (ENVLOAD), and maximizing the window opening rate (WOPR). A real office building case was designed using the MOPBEM to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses of the proposed MOPBEM. The results showed that a high ENVCOST was expended in simultaneously satisfying the low ENVLOAD and high WOPR.

Using a reference model of a conventional office building in the city of Rio de Janeiro and two groups of design parameters, dynamic thermal simulations are systematically applied to optimize design options with the aim to maximize the annual acceptable thermal comfort levels within the occupied spaces. This study not only defines the dimensional parameters to maximize the system airflows, but also investigates the significance of design decisions such as thermal mass and shading devices on the system performance. Options to avoid unintentional reverse flow on the upper floors and maintenance of balanced horizontal airflow rates across the floors are also addressed. Two optimized naturally ventilated building models with DSF are developed and evaluated in terms of thermal performance. Results show that acceptable thermal comfort levels can be met for nearly 70% of the occupied hours. Although the office building will still require other means of cooling during peak summer periods, the incorporation of DSF as part of a mixed-mode ventilation strategy can potentially have a significant impact on annual energy consumption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, significant energy is often wasted in operation due to oversizing to avoid the risk of being undersized. In current practice, throttling of commissioning valves are commonly adopted to push water flowrate (and pressure head) back to the design point no matter how much oversizing exists in a system. That partly mitigates the oversizing problem. This paper presents a novel approach consisting of probabilistic optimal design concerning uncertainties and on-site adaptive commissioning to further maximize energy savings of constant water flow pump systems. Minimized throttling is achieved by on-site adaptive commissioning, which reduces unnecessary pressure head and significant energy consumption. Pumps selected by the probabilistic optimal design can operate under both conventional design conditions and the projected possible off-design (oversized) conditions. The projection is based on the probability distribution of actual pressure head, which is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation by quantifying uncertainties in pressure loss calculation and system construction. Three case studies are conducted to test and validate this new design and commissioning approach. Results show that about 20% energy saving could be achieved, when the system is oversized by 20%, compared to conventional design and commissioning methods. The proposed approach also offers better energy performance in general compared to the designs all using variable speed pumps. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:23","2024-02-20 10:06:23","","53-65","","","202","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","","Architectural design; design method; optimization; Probability distributions; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; building; Energy performance; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; probability; Air conditioning; Uncertainty analysis; Pumps; energy conservation; Monte Carlo methods; energy use; Adaptive commissioning; adaptive management; air conditioning; Air-conditioning; Building energy saving; Conventional design; Flow of water; Monte Carlo analysis; Pressure loss calculations; Probabilistic optimal design; pump; System construction; uncertainty analysis; Variable-speed pumps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fractional factorial design is used to identify the significant design variables. Response surface methodology is used to create surrogate models for the annual cooling and lighting energy with the screened significant variables. The error for these models is less than 10%, validating their effectiveness.

The first analysis, based on the 1st Law only, simultaneously optimises building energy use and design's Net Present Value (NPV). The second analysis, based on the 1st and the 2nd Laws, simultaneously optimises exergy destructions and the exergoeconomic cost-benefit index. Occupant thermal comfort is considered as a common objective function for both approaches. The aim is to assess the difference between the methods and calculate the performance among main indicators, considering the same decision variables and constraints. Outputs show that the inclusion of exergy/exergoeconomics as objective functions into the optimisation procedure has resulted in similar 1st Law and thermal comfort outputs, while providing solutions with less environmental impact under similar capital investments.

The current design methods are usually based on deterministic cooling loads, which are obtained by using design parameters or information. However, these parameters contain uncertainties and they will be different from that used in the design calculation when the cooling system is put in use. The actual cooling load profile will deviate from that predicted in design. By considering uncertainties of these parameters, the sizing and configuration of the cooling system can be improved. In this study, a design optimization method is proposed by considering uncertainties related to the cooling load calculation. Impacts caused by the uncertainties of nine factors are considered, including the outdoor weather conditions, internal heat sources and indoor set-points. The cooling load distribution is analyzed. The oversize problem is explained from the viewpoint of uncertainties. By presenting the probability distribution of the cooling load and the potential capital cost, the proposed method can determine the cooling system capacity with quantified confidence.

The design seeks to make buildings receive more direct sunlight within the limits of the user's comfort and simultaneously save energy and space. So far in China, the design of solar radiation has usually been qualitative, not quantitative, and it is often implemented by architects with experience or those following convention. This rough and rigid design approach is not accurate or efficient, particularly in the design of free-form buildings, which comprise a class of irregular-form buildings popular in current architectural design. Moreover, solar radiation is not the only thing that needs to be considered; shape coefficient and space efficiency should also be considered in free-form building design. This study proposes a method for a free-form building that receives more solar radiation though shape optimization and takes into account the other two objectives mentioned above. This paper provides a method with a ""Modeling-Simulation-Optimization"" framework. In the process of applying this method, parametric modeling with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper is used to build up the free-form building model, and the shape optimization of the building is processed by using the multi-objective genetic algorithm to make sure the three objectives-i.e., to maximize solar radiation gain, to maximize space efficiency, and to minimize the shape coefficient-are all achieved. Finally, a Pareto frontier is generated to show the optimal solutions and to assist designers in making final decisions. The case study shows that compared with the cube-shaped reference building, the total solar radiation gain of the optimized free-form shape building is 30-53% higher, and the shape coefficient value is reduced by 15-20%, with a decrease of less than 5% of the space-efficiency values. The proposed method, according to the basic process of architecture design, uses a performance-driven approach to find solutions that satisfy the requirements. It can be used in real architectural design to solve practical optimization problems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:23","2024-02-20 10:41:29","","38-50","","","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 98</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\RUTJG8ZH\Zhang et al. - 2016 - Shape optimization of free-form buildings based on.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.053","Architectural design; Buildings; architectural design; optimization; Shape optimization; Design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; design; building; genetic algorithm; Algorithms; Optimization problems; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Architecture designs; shape; Solar radiation; China; Parametric modeling; solar radiation; Free-form building; Free-form buildings; Performance-driven; Radiation; Rhinoceros; Severe cold zone; Shape coefficients; Solar radiation gain; Space efficiencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing a BESM is relatively simple in the building design phase because nearly all inputs are known from design parameters. However, in the building operation phase, developing and calibrating a BESM becomes difficult because all operating parameters must be adjusted according to real-time data. All of these parameters are difficult to measure, and they vary over time. Existing calibration methods of BESMs, which involve hundreds of input parameters, lack standard procedures and require specialized engineers. Engineers must randomly adjust input parameters until the output energy use matches measured energy use. To solve the problem above, a new calibration approach with a detailed procedure is proposed in this paper. This approach relies on electricity submetering data and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) cooling/heating loads. These data are becoming more available in commercial buildings. A case study is demonstrated in a large commercial building with satisfying results. The CV (coefficient of variation) and MBE (mean bias error) of the total hourly electricity consumption simulation, excluding HVAC, are 4% and 3%, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: A mix of exploratory and descriptive research methods was used to obtain feedback from 179 role-players involved in various phases of the residential building lifecycle (RBLC) in New Zealand. Empirical data were analysed using content analysis, multi-attribute method and Friedman’s two-way analysis of variance. Findings: Results showed that designers, building owners, main contractors and project managers were the greatest influencers of the productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The priority drivers of these key role-players’ influences on the RBLC productivity outcomes comprised poor brief interpretation, inclination to lowest tender, inadequate prior risk analysis and miscommunication of owner’s requirements and preferences to service providers, respectively. By taking proactive steps to redress their productivity inhibiting acts/omissions as identified in this study, the various role-players could contribute to significant improvement of productivity outcomes in the building lifecycle. Research limitations/implications: It was not possible to interview all participants that made up the representative random samples from each role-player group due largely to workload related excuses. As a result, the findings and the conclusions may not be generalised beyond the study scope. However, the study achieved its purpose, as the main intent was to provide hypothetical constructs that could guide further confirmatory/experimental studies for residential buildings as well as for other building types. Practical implications: A succinct and easy-to-follow model was developed as implementation pathway for operationalising the key findings of the study in the industry. The model highlights the Owner-Architect-Contractor Influence Triangle (OACIT) as the 20 per cent of the solutions that could deliver 80 per cent of the productivity improvement in the RBLC. Originality/value: This study re-examines productivity issues not only from a life-cycle perspective but also from the perspectives of the majority of the key role-players. In addition, the OACIT concept offers a novel productivity improvement tool; it stresses that productivity in the traditionally procured building lifecycle could be optimised if the architect could focus greater attention on brief articulation and the issuance and review of design and specification information. Also, the owner should adopt productivity-enhancing procurement and contract strategies and emphasise more on value-addition and less on lowest tender price. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:24","2024-02-20 10:37:04","","528-551","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEDT-02-2017-0014","Architectural design; Buildings; Structural design; Design/methodology/approach; Life cycle; Construction; Costs; Risk assessment; Residential building; Housing; Life cycle perspectives; Project management; Economics; Productivity; Risk analysis; Construction economics; Construction procurement; Construction project management; Contractors; Cost and lifecycle issues; Productivity improvements; Property development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes an optimal design method for minimizing the volume of the primary structural members (core wall, outrigger, and external columns) and calculating the optimal locations of outriggers using a genetic algorithm with the goal of efficiently controlling the lateral displacement of a high-rise building. The optimal solution of the outrigger system was determined based on the change in the number of stories (from one to four) at which outriggers were installed in a prototype model (a 400-m high-rise building). The results indicate that increasing the number of outrigger installations reduces the total volume of structural members needed in the outrigger system to satisfy the displacement constraint of the top floor (H/500, H: building height). Additionally, the cross-sections of the core wall and outrigger decreased and that of the external column increased, which indicated that the role of the external column in the control of lateral displacements increased as the number of outrigger installations increased. As a result, the contribution of the core wall to the bending moment decreased, which reduced the cross-section of the core wall. These results provide an optimal solution that considers the ideal locations of the outriggers and minimizes the volume of structural members within the maximum lateral displacement range, which is specified as a structural performance constraint. Therefore, this study can provide designers with a well-defined target performance level (e.g., lateral displacement or bending stress) during the initial stage of the outrigger system design process and an economical design that minimizes cost. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:24","2024-03-19 12:35:21","","496-505","","","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 47</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\LNCCVYGA\Park et al. - 2016 - Genetic-algorithm-based minimum weight design of a.pdf","","Architectural design; Buildings; Optimal design methods; Structural analysis; Design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; design; building; displacement; genetic algorithm; High-rise building; Minimum weight design; High rise building; Algorithms; Structural performance; Systems analysis; Optimum designs; Outrigger; Walls (structural partitions); Optimum design; Displacement constraint; Location; Optimum location; Structural members; weight; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, a wedge-shaped design for building bottleneck spaces, including exits, passageways, and joints of intersection, is proposed and described. Furthermore, through numerical simulation using a social force model, the impact of the wedge design on the evacuation time of occupants is investigated. It can be found that the evacuation time is reduced with the wedge design compared to a rectangular design under the same conditions. The effects of the short-side length and angle of wedge (β) are also examined. For the different short-side lengths studied (0.8 and 1.0 m), the mean difference in the evacuation time-saving rate increases at a relatively steady rate with the increase in the long-side length. In addition, simulation results indicate the maximum evacuation time-saving rate appears when β ranges between 45° and 53.13°.

However, this approach does not provide a faithful thermodynamic evaluation of the overall energy conversion processes that occur in buildings, and a more robust approach should be followed. The relevance of Second Law analysis has been here highlighted: in addition to the calculation of energy balances, the concept of exergy is used to evaluate the quality of energy sources, resulting in a higher flexibility of strategies to optimize a building design. Reviews of the progress being made with the constructal law show that diverse phenomena can be considered manifestations of the tendency towards optimization captured by the constructal law.

The focus is put on the Mediterranean Algiers and the Saharan Ghardaia. Dynamic energy modelling was carried out using TRNSYS 17 to assess a residential house built as a MED-ENEC pilot project. The simulation is executed at two sequential stages: the reconnaissance stage where the building is compared to a typically non-insulated conventional construction and then the assessment stage, in which the pilot project already designed to low energy standards is investigated in an attempt to increase its energy efficiency further. By means of a parametric study, the most efficient passive design measures for minimizing heating and cooling energy demands were delineated and their dimensioning fixed. The results confirm i) the easiness to save energy in comparison to the local inappropriate conventional building type, and ii) possible additional energy savings in the pilot project, so that almost no heating is required and the cooling visibly further reduced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:24","2024-02-20 10:39:25","","327-346","","","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 31</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.08.043","Architectural design; Buildings; optimization; Structural design; design; building; Energy efficiency; Ecodesign; Energy conservation; heating; Heating; Housing; cooling; energy efficiency; Green building; Green buildings; numerical method; renewable resource; Heating and cooling; Mediterranean environment; TRNSYS; Alger [Algeria]; Algeria; Algiers; Eco-design; Ghardaia; greenspace; legislation; Subtropics; Warm climate; Warm climates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, an important tool in the study of architectural conservation design is LCA (life-cycle assessment), with the goal of minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact. The research suggests a method to apply LCA analysis and BIM technology to design 3D BIM models and define the relationship between BIM elements and architectural materials. The obvious advantages of combining BIM with LCA have resulted in its wide use for building life cycle assessment. The study propose here quantitative analysis of environmental impact by construction and build an index database for environmental impact assessment of building projects based on analytical hierarchy process. The design plan of the Teaching and Research Building of a University in Nanjing China is taken as the example to calculate energy consumption in response models formed from construction data. From these modeled calculations, then the key environmental impact factors were analyzed. The objective is to suggest an integrated solution to BIM-based environmental impact assessment of building construction and also provide a theoretical support for optimized building design.

In this context, multi-objective optimization has attracted much attention in building design as a tool to study trade-off solutions (“cost” vs “environmental impact”) resulting from the optimization of conflicting objectives. One major limitation of this approach (as applied to building design) is that it is computationally demanding due to the need to optimize several objectives using complex models based on differential equations (which are used to estimate the energy consumed by a building). In this work, we propose a systematic framework for the design of buildings that combines a rigorous objective reduction method (which removes redundant objectives from the analysis) with a surrogate model (which simplifies the calculation of the energy requirements of the building), both of which expedite the identification of alternative designs leading to environmental improvements. The capabilities of our methodology are illustrated through a case study based on a thermal modelling of a house-like cubicle, in which we optimize the insulation thicknesses of the building envelope. Results show that significant economic and environmental improvements can be achieved compared to the base case (cubicle without insulation). Furthermore, it is clearly illustrated how the minimization of an aggregated environmental metric, like the Eco-Indicator 99, as unique environmental objective may overlook some Pareto solutions that may be appealing for decision-makers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:24","2024-02-20 10:06:24","","506-518","","","130","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 39</p>","","","Architectural design; Buildings; Design; Structural design; Life cycle; Economic and social effects; Decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Design of buildings; Surrogate model; Multiobjective optimization; Environmental impact; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Thermal insulation; Conflicting objectives; Differential equations; Energy requirements; Environmental improvements; Environmental objectives; Fuel additives; Insulation; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Modelling; Models; Objective reduction; Systematic framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most of the cases, the definition of the optimal strategy is not trivial because it is necessary to solve a multi-objective problem with a high number of the variables subjected to nonlinear constraints. In this study, a powerful multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm, NSGAII (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II), is used to derive the Pareto optimal solutions, which can illustrate the whole trade-off relationship between objectives. A method is then proposed, to introduce uncertainty evaluation in the optimization procedure. A new university building is taken as a case study to demonstrate how each step of the optimization process should be performed. The results achieved turn out to be reliable and show the suitableness of this procedure to define both economic and environmental performance indicators. Similar analysis on a set of buildings representatives of a specific region might be used to assist local/national administrations in the definition of appropriate legal limits that will permit a strategic optimized extension of renewable energy production.

The development of sustainable buildings seeks to ameliorate this situation mainly by reducing energy consumption. Sustainable building design, however, is a complicated process involving a large number of design variables, each with a range of feasible values. There are also multiple, often conflicting, objectives involved such as the life cycle costs and occupant satisfaction. One approach to dealing with this is through the use of optimization models. In this paper, a new multi-objective optimization model is developed for sustainable building design by considering the design objectives of cost and energy consumption minimization and occupant comfort level maximization. In a case study demonstration, it is shown that the model can derive a set of suitable design solutions in terms of life cycle cost, energy consumption and indoor environmental quality so as to help the client and design team gain a better understanding of the design space and trade-off patterns between different design objectives.

Actually, this system is attracting especially for tall buildings, which may not be suitable for base isolation because large tensile forces exert on them. This paper aims to investigate the control effect of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings that are represented as bending-shear type models. An optimum design criterion integrating stability maximization criterion is developed for such a multi-degree-of-freedom TMD floor integrated high-rise building system. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem with the combination of the stability maximization criterion and H∞ or H2 criterion. Two series of numerical simulations, that is, the cases in which all the floors serve as TMDs and only a limited number of floors serve as TMDs, are conducted. The favorable performance of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings is demonstrated by comparisons with a fixed floor building equipped with additional high-damping devices achieving 10% first modal damping ratio under a various of seismic excitations. The TMD floor system is verified to have satisfying control effect, which can also solve the post-earthquake long-duration vibration problem of high-rise buildings observed in the 2011 great Tohoku earthquake.

They are capable of resisting wind loads, but provide no support for the building structures to which they are attached. Although they are used to enclose many different types of modern building, and although they may be designed to carry any of the outward-facing materials an architect might wish to specify, the stereotypical curtain wall is a skyscraper's fully-glazed outer skin. The materials used in these wall systems, particularly their structural aluminium frames, are produced by energy intensive methods. Even though there is an environmental motive to reduce the embodied energy by minimizing aluminium content, and despite the obvious commercial incentive, it is a difficult mathematical challenge to find optimal extrusion shapes. The authors believe that because of the inherent complexity of the optimization task, in the curtain walls of real buildings, metal is used inefficiently. This paper describes the way in which near-optimal shapes for any particular building's curtain wall extrusions may be found using a parametrically-controlled geometric model in conjunction with a numerical search routine – in this case, a genetic algorithm. When the curtain walls designed for large and recently-constructed buildings by experienced facade engineers are compared with designs developed using the algorithmic techniques described herein, it is consistently the numerically-optimized solutions which are more efficient. The magnitude of the metal savings achieved by applying computational methods will vary from building to building, but this study suggests that in many cases aluminium mass may be reduced by 20% or more. © 2017 Institution of Structural Engineers","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:25","2024-03-25 09:31:10","","147-156","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\FRC78CBC\Lee et al. - 2017 - Optimizing the Cross-sectional Shapes of Extruded .pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2017.03.002","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind load; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Office buildings; Facades; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Building structure; Walls (structural partitions); Embodied energy; Green building; Green buildings; Facade design; Modern buildings; Aluminum; Curtain wall; Curtain-walls; Extruded aluminum; Extrusion; Cross-sectional shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting); 2_Others (aluminium); 7_Part of Building (Curtain wall)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many studies show that passive thermal designs alone are not enough to fully exploit the potential for energy efficiency in buildings: in fact, harmonizing the active elements for indoor thermal comfort with the passive design of the building can lead to further improvements in both energy efficiency and comfort. These improvements can be achieved via the design of appropriate Building Optimization and Control (BOC) systems, a task which is more complex in high-inertia buildings than in conventional ones. This is because high thermal mass implies a high memory, so that wrong control decisions will have negative repercussions over long time horizons. The design of proactive control strategies with the capability of acting in advance of a future situation, rather than just reacting to current conditions, is of crucial importance for a full exploitation of the capabilities of a high-inertia building. This paper applies a simulation-assisted control methodology to a high-inertia building in Kassel, Germany. A simulation model of the building is used to proactively optimize, using both current and future information about the external weather condition and the building state, a combined criterion composed of the energy consumption and the thermal comfort index. Both extensive simulation as well as real-life experiments performed during the unstable German wintertime, demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively deal with the complex dynamics arising from the high-inertia structure, providing proactive and intelligent decisions that no currently employed rule-based strategy can replicate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:26","2024-02-20 10:40:49","","409-420","","","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 39</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\N2GG2DKE\Michailidis et al. - 2015 - Proactive control for solar energy exploitation A.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.033","Architectural design; Buildings; design method; optimization; Design; Structural design; building; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Thermal comfort; insulation; Thermal insulation; Indoor thermal comfort; energy efficiency; climate conditions; Germany; Hesse; solar power; Climate control; Solar energy; Building controls; control system; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient climate control; exploitation; heat flux; High-inertia buildings; inertia; Intelligent decisions; Kassel; Large scale systems; Large scale systems control; Optimization and control; Real-life building control application; Simulation-assisted controls; Thermal comfort index; thermal power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a technique for the wind-resistant optimal design of supertall buildings with a complex structural system including concrete-filled steel tube columns, shear walls, and various types of beams and columns. In each optimal design cycle, the dynamic wind load acting on a building is transformed into a set of multiple-oriented equivalent static wind loads, which converts the optimal design for a building acted by dynamic loads into a simpler optimal design problem that considers only static loads. The objective function and constraint functions are explicitly formulated for various types of frame and area members, and consequently, the optimal design problem is mathematically modeled. The optimality criteria method is employed to seek a solution to the optimal design problem. A 68-story actual supertall building with a height of 303 m is considered for a case study. The obtained results show that the presented technique is capable of giving a good numerical optimal solution for practical use. The technique and results obtained from this study are valuable for academic and professional engineers involved in wind engineering and structural design.

In this work we present a model using a multiple-generation light transport (MGLT) approach to quantify light transport through single-layer luminescent solar concentrators of arbitrary shape and size. We demonstrate that MGLT offers a significant speed increase over Monte Carlo (raytracing) when optimizing the luminophore concentration in large LSCs and more insight into light transport processes. Our results show that optimizing luminophore concentration in a lab-scale device does not yield an optimal optical efficiency after scaling up to realistically sized windows. Each differently sized LSC therefore has to be optimized individually to obtain maximal efficiency. We show that, for strongly self-absorbing LSCs with a high quantum yield, parasitic self-absorption can turn into a positive effect at very high absorption coeficients. This is due to a combination of increased light trapping and stronger absorption of the incoming sunlight. We conclude that, except for scattering losses, MGLT can compute all aspects in light transport through an LSC accurately and can be used as a design tool for building-integrated photovoltaic elements. This design tool is therefore used to calculate many building-integrated LSC power conversion efficiencies. © 2017 Optical Society of America.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:26","2024-02-20 10:06:26","","A547-A563","","12","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 19</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Efficiency; velocity; Building integrated photovoltaic; Built environment; Building integrated; Influential factors; quantitative analysis; adoption; article; built environment; Flowcharting; Light transmission; Luminescence; Luminescent solar concentrators; Optical efficiency; Power conversion efficiencies; quantum yield; Rapid optimization; scale up; Solar concentrators; sunlight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The explored solutions represent building thermal designs integrated with the MPC of HVAC systems. For defining the MPC strategies, the main GA launches two secondary bi-objective GAs that optimize heating and cooling operations, respectively. These secondary GAs perform Pareto optimizations by minimizing operating costs and thermal discomfort. They provide the optimal hourly set point temperatures for heating and cooling operations, with a day-ahead planning horizon, by considering the forecasts of weather conditions and building use. The optimal control strategies are found based on requirements of users, who set a minimum comfort level to be fulfilled. The GAs are implemented by coupling MATLAB® with EnergyPlus.

To fill this gap, this article examines the effects of stochastically generated occupancy schedules on the energy performance of a multiresidential high-rise building located in Shanghai, China. The building's energy performance is analyzed under two design proposals: a law-compliant proposal developed by the designers, and a second proposal conceived through an automatized optimization process. A statistical analysis quantifies the energy implications of adopting different degrees of randomness when creating occupancy and occupancy-dependent schedules. Simulation outcomes show that temporal and spatial randomness of occupancy and occupancy-dependent schedules have a statistically significant influence on the building's energy performance, with an estimated uncertainty of up to 10%. At least in Shanghai, occupant behavior affects cooling more than heating, and its influence on the energy performance is stronger in high-performance buildings than in poorly insulated ones. Finally, accurate modeling of high-performance buildings would require a detailed and precise description of occupancy and occupant-dependent input variables even if this increases the modeling effort and costs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many advanced optimization methods have been developed in recent years to assess building life cycle impact. However, these previous studies have not fully addressed the secondary effects, in other words, indirect effects outside the actual design option. This may lead to conclusions of optimization studies based on misleading calculation results. The main purpose this study was to highlight the relevance of including secondary effects in optimization of building design with respect to global warming potential and cost. This was done by conducting a parameter study of the building envelope insulation thickness with regard to global warming potential and life cycle costs, while considering secondary effects induced by the different design options. Findings from this study show that secondary effects influence the system boundary, algorithm architecture, results and the final conclusions of optimal building design. Omitting secondary effects can thus lead to incorrect decision on optimal solutions with regard to global warming potential and life cycle cost.

Its main objective is to optimize building material combinations, energy-saving technologies and other relevant properties, ensuring that the energy consumption of the building meets the energy-saving demand. This constitutes an inverse problem, which cannot be solved by conventional methods. Therefore, using a new model that combines numerical calculations with an improved genetic algorithm, we elucidate the synergic relationships between thermophysical properties of wall materials. The investigation is conducted on a south-facing wall under the extreme climatic conditions of Chengdu, China. The results confirmed the existence of these synergic relationships. In particular, the thermal conductivity is a linearly increasing function of insulation thickness; however, if the thermal conductivities of two materials of fixed thickness are simultaneously optimized, increasing one conductivity nonlinearly reduces the other conductivity. These two cases confirm the efficiency and reliability of the proposed model in solving inverse problems related to insulation technology. The identified synergic relationships are also very useful in engineering applications, because the designer can select the combination of thermophysical properties most suited to the energy-saving requirements and local market conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the recast of the Directive EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings), Member States have to target nZEBs (nearly zero energy buildings) and minimum energy performance requirements within a cost-optimal framework by 2020.This study reports the comparative methodology reported in the EPBD, aimed at the establishment of cost-optimality in office buildings located in a warm climate. A number of energy efficiency measures have been selected and applied to the envelope and the systems of a virtual reference office building. Technical features and energy performance calculations have been assessed for the obtained configurations. Primary energy consumption and global costs have been derived to identify the cost-optimal configuration from a financial and macroeconomic analysis. The paper shows the suitability of the methodology to support the design of cost-effective energy efficient solutions in new office buildings. Results show technical variants selection able to a decrease primary energy consumption by 39% and CO2 emissions by 41% at the lowest cost.

A decoupling heat storage device between the plant and the heat sink can improve operation flexibility, but increases investment costs. The cost-optimal sizing of plant and storage against time dependent electricity prices is a non-trivial optimisation problem. In this study, we investigate how the optimal design depends on various boundary conditions. We sweep residential and industrial heat demand profiles (5 kW–100 MW peak), electricity price levels and variance and fuel prices. We pair a linear plant model with heat sink and price combinations and use a fast heuristic algorithm to find power, storage size and operating pattern for maximised annual profit over 8760 h. Brake-even is reached with a surplus of 0.03–0.14 €/kWh on today's spot market price (fuel 0.08 €/kWh). Design results for plants ≥ 1 MW power are similar. Future optimal designs are up to 30% larger than today's and profits increase. The design is generally robust on expected price changes due to the flat optimum.

Thus, considering combinations of different types of façade shading systems is an essential aspect in the optimization of daylighting in the building design process. This study explores (1) how the pattern and different characteristics are evaluated by varying façade shading types and considering their impact on daylighting metrics; and (2) the relative relationships between Daylight Autonomy (DA) and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) with changes of the façade shading types, input parameters, and azimuth orientations. A typical high-school classroom has been chosen as a base model, and seven different façade shading types: Vertical louver, horizontal louver, eggcrate louver, overhang, vertical slat, horizontal slat, and light shelf have been applied to eight azimuth orientations for the building. As tools for parametric design and indoor lighting analysis, Design Iterate Validate Adapt (DIVA)-for-Grasshopper has been used to obtain DA and UDI for comparison. Based on the simulation, (1) the effectiveness of the installation of façade shading compared to a non-shading case; and (2) design considerations for façade shading are presented. The result shows that there are some meaningful differences in DA and UDI metrics with the variation of orientation and façade shading types, although all cases of façade shading show some degree of decrease in DA and increase in UDI values. The types of shading devices which produce a dramatic decrease in DA values are the light shelf, horizontal slats, horizontal louvers, and eggcrate louvers. On the contrary, the types of shading devices which produce a dramatic increase in UDI values are the light shelf, horizontal slats, horizontal louvers, and eggcrate louvers. In the case of the vertical and vertical slat shading, the improvements of UDI values are significant in the east and west orientations. This demonstrates that the application and design of shading devices in certain façade orientations should be carefully considered for daylight control. Also, the results show that UDI explains relatively well the daylight performance in the case of the installation of a shading device. © 2017 by the authors.","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:27","2024-02-20 10:06:27","","","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 27</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Azimuth orientation; Building design process; Control theory; Daylight autonomies; Daylight Autonomy (DA); Daylight metrics; Daylighting; Daylighting control; Design considerations; Façade shading; High school classrooms; Louver; Useful daylight illuminance (UDI); Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SVM is capable of fitting a surrogate model with the best prediction performance based on the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. In addition, both single-sided ventilation and cross-ventilation models under varied thermal load requirements are investigated to compare the preferable design solutions for each scenario.

One of these targets is to reduce the energy consumption in healthcare buildings, which are known to be among the most energy-demanding building types. Although design decisions made at early design phases have a significant impact on the energy performance of the realized buildings, only a small portion of possible early designs is analyzed, which does not ensure an optimal building design. We propose an automated early design support workflow, accompanied by a set of tools, for achieving nearly zero emission healthcare buildings. It is intended to be used by decision makers during the early design phase. It starts with the user-defined brief and the design rules, which are the input for the Early Design Configurator (EDC). The EDC generates multiple design alternatives following an evolutionary algorithm while trying to satisfy user requirements and geometric constraints. The generated alternatives are then validated by means of an Early Design Validator (EDV), and then, early energy and cost assessments are made using two early assessment tools. A user-friendly dashboard is used to guide the user and to illustrate the workflow results, whereas the chosen alternative at the end of the workflow is considered as the starting point for the next design phases.

Many multi-objective optimization algorithms have been developed; however few of them are tested in solving building design problems. This paper compares performance of seven commonly-used multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms in solving the design problem of a nearly zero energy building (nZEB) where more than 1.610 solutions would be possible. The compared algorithms include a controlled non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with a passive archive (pNSGA-II), a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), a two-phase optimization using the genetic algorithm (PR-GA), an elitist non-dominated sorting evolution strategy (ENSES), a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the concept of epsilon dominance (evMOGA), a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (spMODE-II), and a multi-objective dragonfly algorithm (MODA). Several criteria was used to compare performance of these algorithms. In most cases, the quality of the obtained solutions was improved when the number of generations was increased. The optimization results of running each algorithm 20 times with gradually increasing number of evaluations indicated that the PR-GA algorithm had a high repeatability to explore a large area of the solution-space and achieved close-to-optimal solutions with a good diversity, followed by the pNSGA-II, evMOGA and spMODE-II. Uncompetitive results were achieved by the ENSES, MOPSO and MODA in most running cases.

The approach proposed here exploits structure decomposition and a bottom-up technique where the elementary building blocks of the transformer circuit of interest are first optimized with respect to specifications extracted from a conventional circuit design, and subsequently, the entire circuit is optimized using the previously obtained building-block dimensions as a starting point. The optimization engine for each stage of the process is adjoint-based gradient search embedded in the trust region framework. The bottom-up approach turns out to be critical from the reliability standpoint: As the initial dimensions obtained from the optimized building blocks already result in reasonably good characteristics of the entire circuit, no global search is required to find a satisfactory design. This is in contrast to direct adjoint-based optimization of the entire circuit which leads to a local optimum, which may not satisfy the imposed requirements. At the same time, computational cost of the design process is reduced compared with direct optimization of the entire circuit, because building block optimization is carried out in low-dimensional search spaces and using simpler (i.e., less expensive) electromagnetic models. Our technique is demonstrated using a three-section impedance matching transformer. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 435 3-D fire simulations were conducted through NIST fire dynamics simulator to analyze thermal behavior of combined buoyancy-induced and pressuredriven smoke flow in complex vertical shafts, under consideration of influence of heat release rate (HRR) and locations of heat sources. This influence was evaluated through neutral pressure plane (NPP), which is a critical plane depicting the flow velocity distributions. Hot smoke flows out of shafts beyond the NPP and cold air flows into shafts below the NPP. Findings - Numerical simulation results show that HRR of heat source has little influence on NPP, while location of heat source can make a significant difference to NPP, particularly in cases of multi-heat source. Identifying the location of NPP helps to develop a more effective way to control the smoke with less energy consumption. Through putting an emphasis on smoke exhausting beyond the NPP and air supplying below the NPP, the smoke control systems can make the best use of energy.

Topology optimization problems utilize the firmest mathematical basis, to account for improved weight-to-stiffness ratio and perceived aesthetic appeal of specific structural forms, enabling the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) technique. Structural topology optimization is a technique for finding the optimum number, location and shape of “openings” within a given continuum subject to a series of loads and boundary conditions. Aerospace and automotive engineers routinely employ topology optimization and have reported significant structural performance gains as a result. Recently, designers of buildings and structures have also started investigating the use of topology optimization, for the design of efficient and aesthetically pleasing developments. This paper examines two examples of where topology optimization may be a useful design tool in civil/structural engineering in order to overcome the frontiers between civil engineers and engineers from other disciplines. The first example presents the optimized structural design of a geometrically complex high-rise structure and the optimal design of its architectural building shape. The second one focuses on the optimization and design of a perforated steel I-section beam, since such structural members are widely used nowadays in the vast majority of steel buildings and structures while they provide numerous advances. Conclusions are drawn regarding the potential benefits to the more widespread implementation of topology optimization within the civil/structural engineering industry. © 2015 JUST.

Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. TMY3 is the latest TMY file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, TMY3 data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961-2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current TMY3 data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over TMY3 direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Serbia has continental climate with hot summers, so that for office buildings, whose internal gains are higher from the presence of people, computer systems and lighting, this means that far more focus has to be put on cooling demands than on heating demands. This shift toward cooling is studied here through exhaustive simulation of combinations of selected passive solar design parameters for a model of an office building in Belgrade. Design parameters include glazing type, window-to-wall ratio of façades, presence of exterior shading and U-value of opaque envelope components. Optimal variants of the model have been determined with respect to construction cost and heating, cooling and lighting energy use. Results reveal that exterior shading, which has to sustain occasional strong winds in Belgrade, is too expensive to appear in cost-optimal solutions. Hot summers of Belgrade climate imply that cost-optimal solutions have close-to-minimal window-to-wall ratio at the southern façade and significantly larger window-to-wall ratio at the northern façade. Results further show that glazing in cost-optimal solutions has to have small U-value and medium solar heat gain coefficient, although specific choices of optimal glazing type, as well as thermal insulation level, depend on future electricity prices. The case study is repeated for climates of Frankfurt and Stockholm as well, which yield similar results with respect to glazing type and the absence of exterior shading, but with different patterns of window-to-wall ratios at the southern and northern façades. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:28","2024-02-20 10:06:28","","492-505","","","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 15</p>","","","Architectural design; Building codes; Buildings; architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; optimization; Design; Optimal systems; Structural design; building; Construction costs; Costs; Energy efficiency; cost analysis; Office buildings; parameterization; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Energy conservation; computer simulation; Parametric analysis; Thermal insulation; Glazes; Lighting; energy efficiency; energy use; Germany; Energy savings; Belgrade; Building regulations; construction; Construction cost; Cooling systems; Cost-optimal solutions; demand analysis; Exhaustive simulation; Frankfurt am Main; Glazing; Hesse; Parametric -analysis; Passive solar design; price dynamics; Serbia; Solar heat gain coefficient; solar power; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, this article introduces a novel compact STF with internally extruded pin-fin flow channel that is particularly suitable for the building integration. A dedicated simulation model was developed on basis of the heat transfer and the flow mechanics. A prototype of this STF was fabricated and then it was tested under a series of controlled environmental conditions. The experimental validation illustrated a good agreement with the simulation results, indicating the established model was able to predict the STF's thermal performance at a reasonable accuracy (i.e. mean deviation of less than 5.46%). The impacts of several operational parameters, i.e. equivalent solar radiation, air temperature, air velocity, water mass flow rate and inlet water temperature, on the STF thermal performance were then discussed respectively. Given the baseline testing condition, the collector efficiency factor F' is almost 0.9930, leading to a relatively high nominal thermal efficiency at about 63.21%, which demonstrates such STF, with simpler structure, lower cost and higher feasibility in architectural design, can achieve an equivalent or better thermal performance than recent bionic STF or the conventional ones. It is also concluded that the thermal efficiency varies proportionally with solar radiation, air temperature, and mass flow rate of water, but oppositely to air velocity and inlet water temperature. A sharp decreasing trend of this STF's thermal efficiency against the (Tin - Ta)/I was observed under the given operational conditions, which indicates current STF design is only suitable for pool heating, domestic hot water and radiant space heating in areas/climates with warm ambient air temperature and sufficient solar radiation. The overall research results are beneficial for further design, optimization and application of such STF in various solar driven systems, including the provision of hot water, space heating/cooling, increased ventilation, or even electricity in buildings. Such STF technology has the potential to boost the building energy efficiency and literally turn the envelope into an independent energy plant, creating the possibility of solar-thermal technologies deployment in high-rise buildings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:28","2024-02-20 10:32:13","","48-64","","","168","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 16</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.021","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; design; building; Energy efficiency; Facades; numerical model; performance assessment; Integration; accuracy assessment; Building energy efficiency; Solar radiation; Environmental conditions; Air; Solar heating; Atmospheric temperature; energy efficiency; solar power; heat transfer; air temperature; solar radiation; ambient air; Building integration; Channel flow; Collector efficiency; Fins (heat exchange); Inlet water temperatures; instrumentation; Mass transfer; Pin fin; Pin-fins; Solar; Solar thermal technology; Space heating; Thermal facade; Water; water temperature; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Designed to work seamlessly with existing commercial finite-element analysis packages, the proposed alternative method provides more realistic estimations of the design load on structural members, and is proved to be practical for daily design practices.

Control devices therefore play a useful role in providing safety to building structures subject to seismic events. In recent years semi-active dampers have gained considerable attention as structural control devices in the building construction industry. Magneto-rheological (MR) damper, a type of semi-active damper has proven to be effective in seismic mitigation of building structures. MR dampers contain a controllable MR fluid whose rheological properties vary rapidly with the applied magnetic field. Although some research has been carried out on the use of MR dampers in building structures, optimal design of MR damper and combined use of MR and passive dampers for real scale buildings has hardly been investigated. This paper investigates the use of MR dampers and incorporating MR-passive damper combinations in building structures in order to achieve acceptable levels of seismic performance. In order to do so, it first develops the MR damper model by integrating control algorithms commonly used in MR damper modelling. The developed MR damper is then integrated in to the seismically excited structure as a time domain function. Linear and nonlinear structure models are evaluated in real time scenarios.

A total of thirteen steel frames that incorporate various types of beam-column connection and bracing configuration are considered for detailed and comparative cost analyses. The three multi-storey buildings consisting of 10, 20 and 30 floors are stiffened according to each of the thirteen steel frameworks to yield thirty-nine test frames for numerical applications. First design optimizations are carried out using an evolution strategy (ES) integrated parallel optimization algorithm to minimize the total member weight in each test frame. An extensive cost analysis is then carried out on the optimized design of each test frame to calculate its estimated construction cost using a cost model that itemizes costs of all production stages including material, manufacturing, erection and transportation. Cost-efficient frameworks are identified for the three steel buildings by comparing estimated costs of the test frames. Furthermore, the variations in cost efficiencies of the steel frameworks versus the storey number (or building height) are scrutinized. The results collected are utilized to reach certain recommendations regarding the selection of economically feasible frames for design of multi-storey steel buildings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:06:29","2024-03-19 09:42:57","","380-396","","","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 18</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GY2J5E4T\Hasançebi - 2017 - Cost efficiency analyses of steel frameworks for e.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcsr.2016.09.002","Architectural design; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Optimization; Costs; Cost effectiveness; Cost accounting; Structural optimization; Evolution strategies; Steel buildings; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Cost estimating; Beam - column connection; Beam-column connections; Bracing configuration; Bracing configurations; Cost efficiency analysis; Materials handling; Multi-storey steel buildings; Parallel evolution strategy; Steel framework; Steel frameworks; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A special attention should be drawn to improve the thermal quality of the building envelope with real consideration of the Tunisian climate specificity. One of the most effective measures is the roof insulation. Therefore, the present study is concerned with the determination of the optimum insulation thickness and the resulting energy savings and payback period for two typical roof structures and two types of insulation materials. An efficient analytical dynamic model based on the Complex Finite Fourier Transform (CFFT) is proposed and validated in order to handle the nonlinear longwave radiation (LWR) exchange with the sky. This model provides a short computational time solution of the transient heat transfer through multilayer roofs, which could be a good alternative to some numerical methods. Both heating and cooling annual loads are rigorously estimated and used as inputs to a life-cycle cost analysis. Among the studied cases, the most economical one is the hollow terracotta-based roof insulated with rock wool, where the optimum insulation thickness is estimated to be 7.9 cm, with a payback period of 6.06 years and energy savings up to 58.06% of the cost of energy consumed without insulation. The impact of the LWR exchange component is quantified and the results show its important effect on the annual transmission loads and, consequently, on optimum insulation thickness. A sensitivity analysis shows the efficiency of cool roofs in the Tunisian climate context, where the cooling energy cost benefits outweigh the wintertime penalty. Comparison of CFFT results with those of sol-air Degree-Hours (DH) shows that optimum insulation thickness and energy savings are overestimated and payback period is underestimated using the latter model. The proposed CFFT model could be an efficient tool for the design and the energy analysis of building envelope components in various climatic locations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:06:29","2024-02-20 10:06:29","","136-148","","","177","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 39</p>","","","architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Mathematical transformations; optimization; Structural design; Life cycle; Costs; Energy efficiency; Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Energy utilization; Heat transfer; Investments; life cycle analysis; Energy conservation; Cost estimating; Life cycle cost analysis; Lifecycle costs; Solar buildings; Roofs; insulation; Insulation; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; roof; Energy savings; Insulation materials; Analytical dynamics; Complex Finite Fourier Transform; Complex finite Fourier transforms; cost-benefit analysis; Fourier transform; heat transfer; Life-cycle cost; Long-wave radiation; longwave radiation; Longwave radiation; Mineral wool; Multilayer roof; Multilayers; numerical method; Optimum insulation thickness; Sols; Transient heat transfer; Tunisia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to account for the uncertainties in random wind excitation, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive and reliable dynamic optimisation technique in the time domain. The optimal lateral stiffness design problem of wind-excited tall buildings consists of (1) identifying the critical dynamic drift response in the time domain and (2) searching for the optimal distribution of element stiffness of the building subject to multiple drift design constraints. The critical time-history drift constraints of a wind-excited building are first treated by the worst-case formulation and then explicitly expressed in terms of element sizing variables using the principle of virtual work. The extreme value distribution and the Gaussian assumption are employed to formulate and simplify the probabilistic drift constraints, which are explicitly considered in the dynamic optimisation problem. The system reliability associated with the interstory drift is estimated approximately by the bound approach to ensure that the most cost-efficient solution also attains an acceptable reliability level.

Such metrics can be useful tools for driving the optimization process of the design of new buildings, for the operational assessment of thermal comfort in existing buildings, or for optimizing the operation of building systems. Recently long-term discomfort indices are employed more and more often in mathematical optimization methods to support the design of buildings where thermal comfort is used as an objective function.Focusing on the summer period, 16 long-term discomfort indices are applied for assessing a sample of different variants of a large office building. Such building variants are obtained by varying in discreet steps some key design parameters of the building envelope, such as steady-state transmittance of components, air permeability, solar factor of glazed units, thermal mass, and the natural ventilation strategy. The values of the 16 indices are compared and contrasted in subsets to identify similarities and differences in assessing the whole sample of building variants. The indices deliver significantly different results with deviations up to 70% with respect to the same building variant and identify diverse optimal-building variants. Accordingly, the choice of the long-term discomfort index has a strong impact on the outcome, and, therefore, this paper is intended to provide clarification on how to employ them in a reliable and conscious manner.Finally, some of the analyzed indices have shown the capability to deliver a similar ranking even based on different comfort models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:06:29","2024-02-20 10:41:46","","114-131","","","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 34</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.12.017","Architectural design; architectural design; optimization; Structural design; Optimization; building; Building optimization; Office buildings; Functions; Mathematical optimizations; Ventilation; Thermal comfort; airflow; assessment method; Building assessment; Key design parameters; Long-term discomfort indices; Operational assessment; Ranking capabilities; Scientific literature; steady-state equilibrium; temperature effect; Thermal comfort models; ventilation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As for the energy system, various combinations were generated depending on the type and capacity of the device used as well as the number of units, energy consumption, and efficiency of the building. Because the design process of energy systems is a critical step in determining the performance of the building throughout the lifecycle, an effective design method is necessary. The proposed method determines the energy system that can minimize the primary energy use and initial investment cost through a multiobjective optimization by calculating the cooling and heating energy consumptions of the building and initial investment cost of the energy system using the load profile by the design-day, and the information in the design phase of the building. This method can support the decision-making process by providing engineers with an alternative proposal for minimizing the initial investment cost and primary energy use by the Pareto analysis after reviewing the design combinations of various energy systems with limited information in the initial design phase. To verify the effectiveness of the methodology, a case study of the two buildings was performed, and the analysis results were compared to the conventional design alternatives. As shown in the case study results, using a method developed in comparison with the conventional result can provide the efficient alternative selection with 80% of initial investment cost and 86% of primary energy use, respectively. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology can provide various optimum results more effectively compared to the conventional design methods. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:29","2024-02-20 10:38:45","","6114-6134","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en8066114","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Costs; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Building energy systems; Multiobjective optimization; Systems analysis; Energy utilization; Investments; Decision making process; Conventional design methods; Alternative selections; Energy system design; Initial investment cost; Investment costs; Limited information; Primary energy use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, constraints can be modeled that make the arrangement of the installed luminaires respect certain aesthetic and structural considerations. From this specification, the system automatically generates a lighting solution for any concrete model instance. The underlying, intricate joint optimization and constraint satisfaction problem is approached with a stochastic scheme that operates directly in the complex subspace where all constraints are observed.

A logical next step consists in connecting parametric designs to applications that evaluate non-geometric aspects such as building physics or structural performance. This brings about new opportunities of collaboration between architects and engineers in the early stages of building design. The ease of testing alternatives by tweaking a set of parameters also opens the door for the application of generic optimization algorithms.

Efficient ventilation strategies with low energy consumption are necessary in order to design and improve the existing forced ventilation systems. This paper assesses the potential use of different strategies, independently from the architectural design, to achieve efficient ventilation. To this end, the airflow pattern and the age of air have been assessed in an en suite bedroom within a Spanish house with the use of computational fluid dynamics predictions. The computational fluid dynamics model predictions were validated by the comparison against experimental measurements, with good agreement. An alternative ventilation strategy is proposed, not affecting the architectural design of the room. Statistical analysis is used to assess and compare the results obtained for the different cases simulated. Results show that although the room has a forced ventilation system, air stagnates and ventilation are not homogeneous. Statistical analysis shows that this strategy produces a significant impact on indoor air quality, particularly in bedroom areas where air tends to stagnate.Practical application: The Spanish Building Code provides a minimum level of air quality within the buildings although it does not ensure an efficient design of the ventilation system, being necessary the use of guidelines or other recommendations to advise the designers in order to achieve efficient ventilation designs. Implementation of strategies independent from the architectural design, as studied in this work, can improve the indoor air quality and therefore reduce the global building energy consumption. In addition, these solutions are recommended for construction works requiring quick-easy implementation without disturbing the inhabitants of a house and allowing the normal use of the building during the refurbishment works. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2013.","2014","2024-02-20 10:06:30","2024-02-20 10:06:30","","529-542","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\4W9ZFL5D\Porras-Amores et al. - 2014 - Assessing the potential use of strategies independ.pdf","","Architectural design; Building codes; optimization; Structural design; Optimization; Construction; Building design; Construction industry; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; building design; Ventilation; Ventilation codes; Air; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; Building energy consumption; Air quality; Statistical methods; Indoor air pollution; Indoor environment; Quality control; Air ages; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; forced ventilation; Forced ventilation; Low energy consumption; means air age; Neonatal monitoring; Ventilation strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To meet this upcoming social demand on tall buildings, practical and efficient design method is proposed for optimal outrigger placement using topology optimization. Outriggers, one of the key structural components in a tall and narrow building, are the horizontal structures which connect the building core (spine) and the exterior surface in order to improve the building's shear stiffness. In the proposed method, the high-fidelity simulation model of a tall building is constructed with multiple finite element types for the core and the reinforcing truss system. The floor-wise outriggers are parameterized using the Simple Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and defined as the design variables. The outrigger placement problem is solved using topology optimization. The continuation method is used for material penalization parameter in order to obtain ""0-1"" design.

Much of the previous published research focuses on the impact of BIM during the detailed design, construction, and postconstruction stages. This paper combines the search and exploration powers of evolutionary computing with BIM during the conceptual stage of design. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology to integrate solutions generated by the interactive and visual clustering genetic algorithm (IVCGA) into a BIM environment to enhance the design information and allow the solutions to be viewed in greater detail as building information models. These models can then be utilized or modified by individual members of the design team to aid in the selection of concept designs that appropriately meet client/design requirements. An Autodesk Revit plug-in application has been developed that enables the IVCGA solution to be transformed into a building information model in a common repository.

With investors in developing economies overlooking all considerations except profit, this paper aims at promoting green construction in Egypt by presenting possible savings that investors could earn. The paper introduces an integrated framework to allow building design stemming from basic sustainable approaches. The framework can function as an optimization/simulation platform to automatically improve building designs. Following the framework principles, a model was developed that functions through four modules: a System Builder to create various envelope systems alternatives; a Building Integrator to form a complete design; a Design Evaluator to assess costs and energy; and Design Adaptation that allows optimization and simulation. The model represents a comprehensive yet easy application tool for cost and energy trade-off analyses that suits early design stage. A comparative analysis showed that green designs exhibited lifecycle and annual energy savings reaching 16.3% and 50%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was performed to show the relationship between changes in electricity prices and percentage saving in lifecycle cost, optimum design and payback period. Furthermore, simulation of possible building designs is conducted to offer trade-off comparison between initial and energy costs of different designs. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","2015","2024-02-20 10:06:31","2024-02-20 10:36:44","","21-40","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17452007.2013.775100","Architectural design; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Computer simulation; Life cycle; Costs; Economic and social effects; Ecodesign; Integrated frameworks; Sustainable development; Sensitivity analysis; Investments; Design optimization; Energy conservation; Sustainable design; sustainable design; Lifecycle costs; Models; Comparative analysis; Green building design; Green buildings; Economics; modeling; Annual energy savings; design optimization/simulation; green buildings; lifecycle cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A hindrance towards the adoption of such methodologies is the need for a mathematical model tailored to each building which is capable of capturing all pertinent dynamics. Developing and tuning such a model can be a time-consuming and costly proposition, and is the main reason why such approaches have found little applicability beyond the research space. The utilization of models constructed in the building design phases - for the reason of estimating energy performance - properly adapted for the task at hand can be a viable methodology to overcome this problem.

The aim of this paper is to show the influence of window design and room layout on heating and cooling demand and daylight availability in office buildings in northern Europe. The results in the paper are based on design calculations for two different room types and daylight measurements on two room scale models in a daylight laboratory. The calculations show the influence of window design parameters on the cooling and heating demand. The daylight measurements show the influence of window design parameters on the availability of daylight. The results have then been combined to show a feasible window design regarding daylight availability and the resulting cooling and heating demands for different window orientations. The results show that in most cases it is possible to find a combination of window share and window solar factor that is feasible with regard to daylight as well as cooling and heating.

The cost minimization is a natural choice as the primary motivation for introducing the multi-objective performance based design concept in the earthquake engineering community was to reduce the observed unacceptable levels of damage costs in buildings for moderate intensity but more frequent earthquakes. This paper describes an approach to calculate the failure and life-cycle costs associated with different levels of damage and their consequences considering the random occurrences of seismic events and uncertainties in the calculated response. The inter-story drift is used as an effective response variable to define fragilities and failure costs, although it is realized that damage of some components may be better expressed in terms of the acceleration response. Since a life-cycle cost-based optimization methodology could be computationally demanding especially for yielding structures, the use a response spectrum method of analysis is considered for the response and failure cost calculations. Comparison of the numerical results, for three example buildings in Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston, obtained by the approximate response spectrum method and accurate time-stepping method utilizing an ensemble of base motions indicates that the response spectrum methods can provide a good estimate of the failure cost for a quick performance-based evaluation of different design alternatives.

This paper combines two aspects of this problem. On the one hand, the traffic flows must be routed through the exit(s) according to some requirements, e.g., the time required to get everyone out is as short as possible. Hence, it is necessary to derive the embedded physics principles of occupant traffic, e.g., based on fluid dynamics laws, especially applicable to occupant traffic in normal (i.e., non-panic) conditions. The principles are helpful solving optimization problems such as finding out how many exits are needed, how wide the aisles should be set, or how to determine the area deployment according to the distribution of people in the building design. On the other hand, occupant traffic flows are dynamic in nature and phenomena related to the evacuation efficiency are examined by the simulation of System Dynamics, which is a way to illustrate and understand complex system behavior changing with time. In a simplified example, considering the typical occupants' behavior modes, we simulate and compute the evacuation efficiency in terms of various building design strategies, to demonstrate the applicability and practical sense of the principles to real-world problems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:06:32","2024-02-20 10:06:32","","76-85","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","","Architectural design; Buildings; optimization; Structural design; Optimization; building; Efficiency; computer simulation; Emergency traffic control; Evacuation; Fluid dynamics; Fluid dynamics model; Pollution control; Problem solving; Public building; Public buildings; System dynamics; System Dynamics; System theory; traffic management; Traffic stream; Traffic streams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because subway tunnels cross the building underground, inclined columns, the second and third floor underground together function as the underpinning structures. Different from traditional transform beam, the proposed underpinning structures show good performance without using large dimensional bending members. Special attentions should be paid to the beams connecting with the inclined column in the underpinning structures, and these beams show large tensile or compressive forces.

This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed facades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability.  2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:10","2024-02-20 10:23:10","","577-591","","","154","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.090","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Multiobjective optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Solar buildings; Lighting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:10","2024-02-20 10:23:10","","","","","254","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120012","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; Ecodesign; Construction industry; Sustainable development; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Historic preservation; Climate change; 3D modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The investors and planners are increasingly requiring design tools as decision support instruments, which would enable simulation and optimization of LCC already in the early planning phases. This paper will present a comparative study of three commercial software-tools for LCC-calculation, and test their fitness for the implementation in the early design phases. Using a Case Study of an energy efficient building, LCC were assessed employing the three tools and the deviations of the results were compared. The analysis showed, that the tested tools cannot be employed in the early design phases without adoption and customization, lacking of benchmarks and extensive data representing the largest problem for a reliable LCC calculation and optimization.

Although there is a methodology for this integration, the BIM requires some improvements to foster the adoption of IPD. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative way to support 4D BIM automation/optimisation within the IPD approach. Similar to structural and architectural design libraries, this research proposes a planning library to enable automating the formulation of schedule, as well as embedding the multi-objective optimisation into the 4D BIM. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review was used to highlight the existing attempts to support the automation process for 4D BIM and the multi-objective schedule optimisation for construction projects. A case study was done to validate the developed framework and measure its applicability. Findings: The results show that there is a cost-saving of 22.86 per cent because of using the proposed automated multi-objective optimisation. The case study shows the significance of integrating activity-based costing into 4D BIM to configure the hierarchy level of overhead activities with the IPD approach; therefore, the maximum level of contribution in managing the IPD project is 33.33 per cent by the trade package level and the minimum contribution is around 8.33 per cent by the project level.

In recent years, there is an increasing interest to optimize the fuzzy logic controller with different metaheuristics and nature inspired approaches. This paper focuses on the optimization of a fuzzy controller applied to the seismically excited nonlinear buildings. In the majority of cases, this problem is formulated based on the linear behavior of the structure, however in this paper, objective functions and the performance criteria are considered with respect to the nonlinear responses of the structures. The optimization algorithm is based on the implementation of ant lion optimizer and Jaya algorithm as a hybrid method. The new method is utilized to design a fuzzy controller for two benchmark buildings with nonlinear behavior.

Further uptake of EAs in this industry is hindered by BPS being computationally intensive: optimisation runs taking days or longer are impractical in a time-competitive environment. Surrogate fitness models are a possible solution to this problem, but few approaches have been demonstrated for multi-objective, constrained or discrete problems, typical of the optimisation problems in building design. This paper presents a modified version of a surrogate based on radial basis function networks, combined with a deterministic scheme to deal with approximation error in the constraints by allowing some infeasible solutions in the population. Different combinations of these are integrated with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and applied to three instances of a typical building optimisation problem. The comparisons show that the surrogate and constraint handling combined offer improved run-time and final solution quality. The paper concludes with detailed investigations of the constraint handling and fitness landscape to explain differences in performance.  2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:11","2024-02-20 10:23:11","","114-126","","","33","","Applied Soft Computing Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\3TKKPQ7M\Brownlee and Wright - 2015 - Constrained, mixed-integer and multi-objective opt.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.04.010","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Constrained optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Integer programming; Radial basis function networks; Climate change; Constraint handling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, none of the previous studies have quantified the energy reduction and their environmental impacts simultaneously for these passive design parameters to achieve the national standard requirements for house rating. Hence, this study focuses on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM-Autodesk Revit), energy rating tool (FirstRate5), and BIM-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA-Tally) to quantify, compare, and improve the building design options to reduce carbon footprint and energy consumptions in residential dwellings. Sensitivity analysis has been performed with the @Risk Palisade decision tool for optimizing operational energy efficiency. The sensitivity indices show the ceiling (0.840.96) and the wall (0.220.37) are the most influential predictors for passive design strategies to reduce energy consumption. A moderate correlation exists with windows, floors, and orientations (0.130.29), where the relationship with eave projection, air infiltrations is relatively weak. BIM has been used as a platform of interconnectivity between optimized operational energy of @Risk optimizer and consequent embodied phases. A comparative study of insulation performance identifies that 95% of the ceiling's total operational energy consumption can be minimized using R3 rather than R6 of the national thermal code. For the wall, 90% of energy minimization can occur using R2 rather than R4 of the national thermal code. The study reveals that while insulation is only 1% of the total building mass, and the corresponding carbon footprint and primary energy demand are 4% and 7%, respectively, LCA explains a significant amount of energy, about 76% reduction at its operational stage.

This study presents a methodology to optimize the design of fixed, parametrically modelled PV integrated shading devices (PVSDs) based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) coupled with integrated thermal, electric, and lighting simulations. The goal of this work is to gain insight into the potential benefits of using optimization algorithms for PVSD design. This task is carried out by evaluating the extent to which competing solar energy uses can be balanced with regard to thermal, visual and electrical parameters; and investigating whether existing simulation tools successfully characterize the complexity associated with PVSDs. The methodology developed is used to design and assess the performance of different optimized configurations of a fixed exterior louvre PVSD installed on the southern face of an office building in a Nordic climate. The parameters used for the optimization were the number of louvre-blades as well as their individual tilt angle and position along the vertical axis. This allowed the introduction of a higher degree of eclecticism through the optimization process compared to standard shading systems. The three objectives of the optimization were the total net energy demand, the energy converted by the PV material, and the daylighting level in the zone measured as the continuous daylight autonomy. The results highlighted that configurations with smaller louvres counts were preferable for the specific case study and that optimization increased the performance of the PVSD compared to a reference case. The results of the study also demonstrated that the application of the proposed methodology was able to improve the exploitation of solar energy through a multi-domain facade, and thereby that advanced simulation tools, in this case, allowed overcoming the limitations of more standardized facade configurations. Based on these findings, it is assumed that methodologies like the one developed in this article can be a starting point to stimulate successful discussion and foster fruitful collaboration between researchers, stakeholders, and facade manufacturers, resulting in the development of innovative technological solar integrated facade solutions.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:11","2024-02-20 10:23:11","","731-744","","","247","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.033","Architectural design; Structural design; Office buildings; Facades; Multiobjective optimization; Daylighting; Solar power generation; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a practically effective and computationally efficient model predictive control algorithm is proposed to optimize building energy usage while maintaining thermal comfort in a multi-zone medium-sized commercial building. This article has two themes. Driven by the challenge of fully evaluating the benefit of the proposed model predictive controller against baseline control, a model predictive control design framework is first presented with its performance benchmarked based on a high-fidelity building HVAC simulation environment to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. Following the same model predictive control design framework, the experimental results from the same building located at the Philadelphia Navy Yard are then presented. For the simulation study, the performance of the model predictive control algorithm was estimated relative to baseline days with exactly the same internal loads and outdoor conditions, and it was estimated that model predictive control reduced the total electrical energy consumption by around 17.5%. For the subsequent experimental demonstration, the performance of the model predictive control algorithm was estimated relative to baseline days with similar outdoor air temperature patterns during the cooling and shoulder seasons, and it was concluded that model predictive control reduced the total electrical energy consumption by more than 20% on average while improving thermal comfort in terms of zone air temperature. 2015 ASHRAE.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:11","2024-02-20 10:23:11","","721-733","","6","21","","Science and Technology for the Built Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23744731.2015.1061888","Architectural design; Structural design; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Thermal comfort; Model predictive control; Atmospheric temperature; Predictive control systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures (ECMs) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration. This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process.

Their deployment is occurring rapidly as many countries are planning to make it mandatory for new developments. Despite the advancements in research in the various aspects of NZE, significant barriers do exist to its successful adoption and implementation, particularly with respect to high-rise residential buildings which are becoming a major portion of the housing supply in Australia. One of the challenges attributed to the achievement of NZEB performance is the uncertainty involved in selecting appropriate solution strategies that could deliver quality performances. This paper investigated strategies that can deliver NZE performance for high-rise residential buildings in Australia. A calibrated model of 26 storey high-rise apartment building with 396 units was prepared for detailed analysis of NZE strategies using building simulation. The impact of various interventions was evaluated across cities in five climate zones in Australia and a guideline for solution sets that can deliver the goal for each climate zone is presented. The findings show that NZE performance for high-rise residential buildings can be realised in Australia, albeit with some limitations. While the tropical, subtropical and cold temperate climates appear to be more challenging, proper design and optimisation of the envelope proved to be effective in overcoming the challenges imposed by the more demanding climates. The impacts of shading from neighbouring buildings and objects presented the largest impediment to energy production through the facade.  2021 The Author(s)","2022","2024-02-20 10:23:11","2024-02-20 10:23:11","","158-174","","","231","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.11.030","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Tropics; Apartment houses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In practice, the outrigger truss consists of triangular or Vierendeel types to stiffen tall buildings, and the decision of outrigger design has been qualitatively achieved by only engineers' experience and intuition, including information of structural behaviors, although outrigger shapes and the member's connectivity absolutely affect building stiffness, the input of material, construction ability and so on. Therefore the design of outrigger trusses needs to be measured and determined according to scientific proofs like reliable optimal design tools. In this study, at first the shape and connectivity of an outrigger truss system are visually evaluated by using a conceptual design tool of the classical topology optimization method, and then are quantitatively investigated with respect to a structural safety as stiffness, an economical aspect as material quantity, and construction characteristics as the number of member connection. Numerical applications are studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design process to generate a new shape and connectivity of the outrigger for both static and dynamic responses.

Over 80 sustainability features of the architecture and building systems have considered the life-cycle carbon emissions, including the embodied carbon of construction materials, emissions associated with the construction process, the 50- years of operation and decommission of the building. The total life-cycle carbon emission was off-set by on-site renewable energy generated by photovoltaics (PV) and bio-diesel combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system. To optimise the design, a series of climate-responsive strategies on passive architecture were applied to the construction of the building. These include the high-performance facade, effective air tightness and optimised window design that allows the application of natural ventilation and daylighting. Reduction of 20% energy demand was achieved by these passive designs. To further lower the carbon emission on operation, energy-efficient air-conditioning (A/C) systems using desiccant dehumidification, underfloor air supply and radiant cooling have also contributed on achieving an ultralow energy use value.

Previous studies have attempted to optimize the layout plan of residential buildings for minimizing the total energy usage, mainly focusing on low-rise houses of a regular shape and having a limited number of design variables. However, layout design for high-rise residential buildings involves the complicated interaction among a large number of design variables (e.g., different types of flats with varying configurations) under practical design constraints. The number of possible solutions may increase exponentially which calls for new optimization strategies. Therefore, this study aims to develop an energy performance-based optimization approach to identify the most energy-efficient layout plan design for high-rise residential buildings. A simulation-based optimization method applying the evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to systematically explore the best layout design for maximizing the building energy efficiency. In an illustrative example, the proposed optimization approach is applied to generate the layout plan for a 40-storey public housing in Hong Kong. The results indicate that GA attempts to maximize the use of natural-occurring energy sources (e.g., wind-driven natural ventilation and sunlight) for minimizing 3040% of the total energy consumption associated with air-conditioning and lighting. The optimization approach provides a decision support basis for achieving substantial energy conservation in high-rise residential buildings, thereby contributing to a sustainable built environment.  2019","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:12","2024-02-20 10:23:12","","1375-1388","","","231","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.324","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Air conditioning; Ventilation; Housing; Historic preservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do it, the authors have taken into account variables such as intrinsic metallic design, span length, intumescent paint thickness, and fire time exposure, which offers information about new scenarios of design in industry. Design/methodology/approach - The key methodology followed has taken into account a modeling program that uses the following variables: 25 and 35 m of span, 45 and 60 fire exposure times, and seven different intumescent paint thickness. An optimum structural design has been evaluated by discretization of each scenario with the particular type of steel, S275 and FR. The obtained approach could be a good guideline for future designs. Findings - The results and analysis have shown a very good and valid idea of a new structural typology using optimum intumescent paint thickness into the final design of the industrial frame considering that it has two different types of steel. It is in realty a handicap since usually mechanical engineers employ structural steel without paying attention to this new feature. Practical implications - Cheaper structural designs could be obtained using the two different types of steel considering the proper positioning into the full building.

Therefore, this paper proposes a probabilistic analysis and design method to incorporate these uncertainties. The embedded Monte Carlo based uncertainty and sensitivity analyses investigate the output distributions. To greatly reduce computational efforts, meta-models can be incorporated, replacing the original model. Additionally, multi-layered sampling schemes are used to subject all design options to the same uncertainties and to check the validity of optimisation results for potential scenarios. Since reliability is a key aspect in this methodology, the paper also focuses on output convergence and method reliability. To optimise both average performances and spread, effectiveness and robustness RP are introduced as output uncertainty indicators, inspired by robust design. Here, effectiveness is defined as the ability of the design option to optimise the performance, while robustness is defined as the ability to stabilise this performance for the entire range of input uncertainties.

In residential high-rise buildings, there are certain complications due to residential conditions. Given the high population density of these buildings, it is important to analyze their vertical access performance for emergency evacuations. This study aims to find the optimal placement and layout of vertical access in residential high-rise buildings. It asks: What is the most optimal solution to vertical access placement design in residential high-rise buildings? To answer this, human behavior simulation models during an emergency evacuation in residential high-rise buildings were first analyzed, and the best model was selected. Based on the human behavior models, the vertical access placement was then optimized to evaluate the optimal structures of four types of 60-story residential buildings designed and compared in SFPE and Steering simulation engines. The scenarios differ in vertical access placement. The simulations are conducted in four parts, which include how people placement on each floor, considering disabled persons along with assisted evacuation, and the fire-involved stories and the blocked stairs. According to the research results, a cost-effective core that solves structural problems and provides vertical access will not necessarily be the right solution to the emergency evacuation of high-rise buildings. Instead, placing vertical access features such as stairs and elevators on two opposite sides of a building plan can reduce the total evacuation time by 20%.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:13","2024-02-20 10:23:13","","","","","43","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102856","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Cost effectiveness; Housing; Behavioral research; Population statistics; Disabled persons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Passages through buildings are considered promising to strengthen the local wind resource availability but information concerning their design and performance is scarce. Therefore, two key design parameters that can enhance the wind energy performance of ducted openings in high-rise buildings are addressed and optimized via CFD simulations: the fillet radius (r) of the opening and the duct diameter (d0). 3D steady RANS simulations are performed and validated with wind tunnel data from the literature. Fillets are shown to suppress flow separation, thereby enhancing the magnitude and uniformity of the wind speed in the duct and reducing the turbulent kinetic energy. With a reference diameter d0 = D, the best-performing configuration has a normalized fillet radius r/d0 = 0.2, which increases the average wind speed in the duct by 65% and the wind power by 354%. Modifying the duct diameter alone has limited influence. However, combining a larger duct diameter d0 = 1.5D with fillets with r/d0 = 0.4, can yield up to 78% increase in average wind speed and 650% in wind power density. Findings indicate that the dimensionless wind speed in the duct (U/U0) scales closely in proportion to the normalized fillet radius (r/d0). With these results, the present study demonstrates the aerodynamic advantage of ducted openings in buildings and identifies relevant design conditions required to improve the wind resource availability for the prospective implementation of wind turbines.  2021 The Authors","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:13","2024-02-20 10:23:13","","","","","202","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108028","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind tunnels; Aerodynamics; Wind effects; Speed; Availability; Computational fluid dynamics; Wind turbines; Ducts; Energy harvesting; Flow separation; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Wind power; Wind speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a methodology for development of a Building Information Modeling (BIM) based decision support system PARADIS, which generates and evaluates optimal and holistic renovation scenarios tailored toward the renovation of dwellings in a Danish context. PARADIS supports the renovation sector with the following features: (a) optimizing the selection process of renovation alternatives, and the generation of renovation scenarios, through specific renovation typologies and constraints; (b) evaluating standard sustainability Key Performance Indicators (e.g. energy consumption, investment cost, indoor thermal comfort, etc.) over the generated renovation scenarios; and (c) visualizing the generated renovation scenarios for ease of comprehension by the designers, and for enabling discussion between expert stakeholders (i.e. engineers, contractors, facilities managers) and non-expert stakeholders (e.g. building occupants, owners, etc.). PARADIS thus supports informed decision making for optimal renovation scenario design.

A simultaneous acquirement of these tasks is a necessity to achieve an overall optimal design. However, such mutual optimizations become a complex problem, implying a high computational effort. A greater challenge appears once the uncertainties of boundary conditions such as weather conditions, user demands and energy costs are taken into account. A common approach to protect the suggested system configuration against the possible uncertainties is a stochastic optimization which results in a robust design.In this paper, first the sensitivity of the design to selected boundary conditions is extensively investigated. In a second step, the resulting designs of the deterministic and stochastic optimizations are compared for several uncertainties. All optimizations are setup using a previously developed framework which is extended to solve the stochastic optimization problem. The comprehensive analyses show that the achievement of a robust design is computationally demanding and not even desirable in general.

Using structural lateral system of super tall buildings as engineering background, the paper developed a practical fractional numerical optimization method (FNOM), which applies fractional strategy and quasi-constant assumption, to reduce material cost and embodied carbon cost by searching the optimal structural dimensions. Firstly, two kinds of relationships among optimization variables (structural dimensions), driven design constraints (the interstory drift and the natural period) and optimization objective (cost including material cost and embodied carbon cost) are mathematically modelled. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then introduced to search the optimal structural dimensions based on the quasi-constant assumption of virtual work and internal work of the inactive components. Thirdly, fractional strategy is applied to create assemblies composed of different structural component sets, and the assemblies are then to be optimized in proper sequences. Fourthly, FNOM is implemented as a user-friendly software called C-FNO to practically support the preliminary design of super-tall buildings. Finally, a 700 m high super-tall building is employed to illustrate FNOM by using C-FNO, and the results show that only three design constraints of the interstory drift, the natural period and the stress ratio need to be solved during each optimization step. Belt truss, mega column, outrigger truss and shear wall of the super tall building should be optimized in sequence to save more cost. A great amount of cost can be still saved for the super tall building with the normal traditional design.  2019","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:14","2024-03-06 09:29:48","","934-953","","","79","","Applied Mathematical Modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GKMT6YJN\Wang et al. - 2020 - A practical fractional numerical optimization meth.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.10.067","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithms; Structural optimization; Numerical methods; Cost engineering; Trusses; C (programming language); 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we report on how a recently introduced Parametrized Cognitive Adaptive Optimization - abbreviated as PCAO - can be used toward the design of both model-based and model-free ""plug-and-play"" BOC systems, with minimum human effort required to accomplish the design. In the model-based case, PCAO assesses the performance of its control strategy via a simulation model of the building dynamics; in the model-free case, PCAO optimizes its control strategy without relying on any model of the building dynamics. Extensive simulation and real-life experiments performed on a 10-office building demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCAO-BOC system in providing significant energy efficiency and improved thermal comfort. The mechanisms embedded within PCAO render it capable of automatically and quickly learning an efficient BOC strategy either in the presence of complex nonlinear simulation models of the building dynamics (model-based) or when no model for the building dynamics is available (model-free).

As light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires are highly energy efficient, the amount of power consumed for lighting purposes can be reduced, even in situations where the lighting system is at its full power. It has already been demonstrated that LED-lighting technologies can facilitate significant energy savings through minimizing window size (the main source of heat loss in buildings), and there is considerable potential for developing the LEDs source efficacy and lighting-product efficiency to ultimately achieve levels of efficacy of approximately 350 lumens per Watt (lm/W). For building designs to be sustainable in the future, it is critical that the windows-to-wall ratio (WWR) is optimized to minimize both heating and cooling loads, as well as the total energy consumed by the building for lighting, according to the efficiency of the LED, while still maintaining a suitable lighting level for occupants. This research examines the influence of the WWR on the total amount of energy consumed by standard buildings in Jordan using various LED luminaires (existing and projected efficiencies). DesignBuilder software was utilized to analyze the effect of LED-technology development on optimizing the WWR for a typical residential structure in Jordan. The research presents beneficial recommendations with respect to optimizing the WWR for primary decision-makers in the design of residential buildings with enhanced energy efficiency, considering the losses and gains associated with solar heat and light to capitalize on solar energy with no adverse impacts by windows size. The outcomes suggest a WWR of 17% could be achieved by typical residential buildings in Jordan that have extremely efficient LED lighting systems (350 lm/W), which is more than 50% less than the existing level of 40% recommended by multiple standards. Additionally, this study highlighted that when the efficiency of LED technologies increases, the energy demand of the building will be reduced because of lower energy usage combined with heat gain resulting from the LED efficiency.  2021 by the authors.

However, achieving successful classroom designs is rather complicated, as it requires the balancing of various interrelated factors, which is particularly challenging for hot and dry climates. In recent years, major improvements have been made in building optimization methods, and genetic algorithms used to search for high performing design solutions have shown their efficiency in solving such complex problems. This study shows how such an approach can be applied to optimize the thermal, lighting and energy performance of a middle school classroom in a hot and dry climate. Using a parametric approach and evolutionary multi-objective computation via Octopus plug-in for Grasshopper, various windows-to-wall ratios, wall materials, glass types, and shading devices were combined, to derive potential solutions that achieve a good balance between daylight provision and thermal comfort, while ensuring low energy consumption. The results show that improvements in useful daylight illuminance, adaptive thermal comfort and energy efficiency could be achieved through modification of building envelope parameters. Solutions for different building orientations are explored, providing recommendations for window-to-wall ratios in school buildings in a hot and dry climate. The results demonstrate how an optimization methodology can be used in the early stages of the building design process to understand how the building envelope can be tailored to ensure good building performance, both in terms of comfort and energy performance.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:14","2024-02-20 10:23:14","","","","","204","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108173","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Multiobjective optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Solar buildings; Thermal comfort; Lighting; School buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a comprehensive literature review on simulation-based approaches to optimize passively designed buildings is conducted and corresponding research gaps are identified. Based on existing research methods, modelling experiments on a generic building are conducted to integrate robust variance-based sensitivity analyses with an early-stage design optimization process. Proposed mixed-mode ventilation and lighting dimming control algorithms are applied to the EnergyPlus model to simulate the total lighting and cooling energy demands by incorporating the related design criteria in a local green building assessment scheme. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is then coupled with the modelling experiment to obtain the Pareto frontier as well as the final optimum solution. Different settings of NSGA-II are also investigated to improve the computational efficiency without jeopardizing the optimization productivity.

The current methodology is applied to a newly developed theoretical Reference Building (RB) for a Belgian passive roof stacking house. Different options of the building's superstructure components (walls, roof, and windows) have been examined.

The feasibility of 3DP earth-based materials has been under investigation in recent years, with a particular focus on cob due to its favourable characteristics toward the 3DP process. Yet, there is a lack of definitive information on the construction of 3DP cob. Hence this paper investigates the structural feasibility of 3D-printed cob walls in low-rise buildings. The investigation involved experimental compression tests on 3DP cob samples to obtain key mechanical properties including the compressive strength and elastic modulus. These properties were then used as inputs for structural analyses with respect to three alternate types of 3DP cob wall patterns to evaluate their load-carrying capacity based on a limit-state design framework. Results from the analyses were implemented in modelling an idealised low-rise cob building covering a range of floor spans and wall heights. The analytical study found that 3D-printed walls have the potential to sustain gravity loads typical of residential construction. Further, since the 3DP material was shown to have similar mechanical performance to conventional (non-3DP) cob on the material scale, the 3D-printing process provides the opportunity to produce wall sections that are structurally more efficient than the solid section used in conventional cob construction. This results in lower material consumption, making 3DP cob attractive from the point of view of resource efficiency. An important outcome of the study is the demonstration of a model design technique for low-rise 3DP cob buildings that could be implemented as part of a broader optimisation procedure to satisfy structural and architectural design objectives.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:16","2024-03-19 12:17:41","","","","","301","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\N47XTIYF\Gomaa et al. - 2021 - Feasibility of 3DP cob walls under compression loa.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124079","Architectural design; Structural design; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Environmental impact; 3D printers; Compressive strength; Environmental technology; Compression testing; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 5_Others (1/2 stories, low rise)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high potential of buildings towards energy efficiency has drawn special attention to the passive design parameters. A comprehensive study on optimal passive design for residential buildings is presented in this paper. Twenty-five different climates are simulated with the aim to produce best practices to reduce building energy demands (for cooling and heating) in addition to the life-cycle cost (LCC). The occupants adaptive thermal comfort is also improved by implementing the appropriate passive cooling strategies such as blinds and natural ventilation. In this respect, the implemented methodology is composed of four phases: building energy simulation, optimization, Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM), sensitivity study, and finally an adaptive comfort analysis. An optimal passive solution of the studied building indicates the potential to save up to 54%, 87% and 52% of the cooling demands (Qcool), heating demands (Qheat) and LCC respectively with respect to the initial configuration. The obtained optimal passive parameters are validated with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL benchmark for low energy building's envelope.

The emissions embodied in materials and the solar irradiation incident on the building envelope were estimated in the early design stage. A three-steps optimization process through evolutionary solvers, such as Galapagos (one-objective) and Octopus (multi-objective), has been conducted to shape the most environmentally responsive ZEB model in both climates. The results demonstrated the replicability of the algorithm to optimize the solar irradiation by producing an increment of solar incident irradiation equal to 35% in the Mediterranean area, and to 20% in the Nordic climate. This could contribute to compensate the additional 15% of emissions due to the higher quantities of employed materials in the optimized design.

The results of the simulation show that the integration of super-efficient appliances powered with the grid-tied solar power system is a good option to control the energy consumption of the residential buildings and to reduce the cost of electricity and greenhouse gas emissions: low building energy consumption (reduction by half of the electrical power consumption: from 62.91 to 30.78kWh/day using super-efficient appliances); all the electrical power demand for the building is met without shortage; the power systems produce low excess power (0.291.82%) compared to the off-grid power system; all the extra power from the solar PV is sold back to the grid to reduce the cost of energy, high renewable fraction (68% of the total energy served to the load is produced from solar PV), low-cost of electricity (12% reduction of the cost of energy compared to the utility grid), and low greenhouse gas emissions (4551% reductions of the CO2, NOX, and SO2 emissions compared to the conventional electrical appliances).  2019, Springer Nature B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:16","2024-02-20 10:23:16","","291-305","","2","13","","Energy Efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12053-019-09773-3","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Solar energy; Electric power utilization; Electric power generation; Electric power system control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the various opportunities present for minimising the carbon footprint of buildings, optimising the material selection of building components is one plausible avenue for significant carbon reductions. In the construction of opaque load-bearing walls, the thermal performance of the construction build up is the parameter that has the greatest influence over building operational carbon emissions, with thicker profile walls leading to lower U-values and hence lower operational carbon from heating and cooling. Conversely, the extra wall material contributes to increased embodied carbon. The aim of this study is to capture such trade-off between embodied carbon and U-value by presenting a practical optimisation model to design load bearing walls in commercial and residential buildings. In particular, two objective functions are incorporated within the proposed model for the structural design and material selection of the wall layers; the first objective minimises the embodied carbon of the wall while the other minimises the U-value of the wall. The variables forming the optimisation model include the thickness of each wall layer, and the choice of material forming each layer. The proposed model is tested on a practical case example applicable in Australia and the UK, involving a load bearing wall. Results are reported in the form of a Pareto efficient frontier. Utilising the model enables the realisation of the impacts of material selection and wall layering on embodied carbon and U-value of the building structure.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:16","2024-02-20 10:23:16","","657-671","","","174","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.05.061","Architectural design; Structural design; Construction; Economic and social effects; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Integer programming; Walls (structural partitions); Carbon footprint; Binary alloys; Potassium alloys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most situations, the prefabricated building assemblies are installed by labor crews manually. If some assemblies are ill-designed, clashes between labor crews workspaces and them may occur, which will have bad effect on workers productivity and even incur hazard. The purpose of this paper is to provide a 4D building information modeling (BIM) based approach to find potential workspace conflicts during the installation process of prefabricated building assemblies in the detailed design process so as to eliminate them in advance. Design/methodology/approach: First, a workspace modeling method is provided; second, three kinds of workspace conflicts are analyzed; third, a 4D-BIM-based approach is established; fourth, a prototype tool based on the approach is developed; and finally, a case study is conducted to test the tool. Findings: The result shows that the proposed tool can detect or precaution workspace conflicts and visualize them in a series of views; in doing so, valuable information can be obtained for improving the design quality of prefabricated assemblies. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach and tool only concern the congestions caused by ill-designed prefabricated components; the tool needed to be further optimized for speed; the tests on the tool are limited to a single case study; and more tests are needed to verify its effectiveness. Originality/value: This research provides a 4D-BIM-based approach and a prototype tool for installation workspace analysis.

However, there are shortcomings in achieving these goals. The Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy Performance Directive of Buildings, and Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers have recently focused on dynamic facade design that can considerably contribute to energy-efficient building design and low-emission development. This study comprehensively investigates and identifies dynamic facade typologies, technologies, and techniques while comparing and synthesizing them against architectural design, structural engineering, and material science. In particular, the study investigated the applications, functionalities, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) of dynamic facades. In addition, the structural and architectural characteristics, environmental performance, and effectiveness of dynamic facades (clustered into opaque, transparent, and semi-transparent surface types) have been explored and synthesized. The study concludes that applying the dynamic facade concept entails challenges and opportunities for building developers, users, and auditors. Furthermore, dynamic facade design is a trade-off between environmental analysis data (such as luminance and solar radiation) and user comfort and satisfaction with both the light and thermal intensity of external and internal environments. In addition, dynamic facades can actively and selectively control the heat transfer and energy flow while potentially reducing the internal heating and cooling loads. Therefore, adaptive facades are designed based on behavior changes at the micro-scale (i.e., material structure) or macro-scale (i.e., moving part configuration).  2022","2022","2024-02-20 10:23:16","2024-02-20 10:23:16","","","","","167","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112647","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Heat transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robust design techniques can, however, be a viable option for tackling future challenges. The concept of robust design was first introduced by Taguchi in the 1940s. The result of the design process is a product that is insensitive to the effect of given sources of variability, even though the sources themselves are not eliminated. A robust design optimization (RDO) method is for the first time proposed in this paper, for supporting architects and engineers in the design of buildings with robust energy performance under climate change and extreme conditions. The simplicity and the low computational demand of the process underlies the feasibility and applicability of this method, which can be used at any stage of the design process. The results show that the performance of the optimum solution not only has a 81.5% lower variation (less sensitivity to climate uncertainty) but at the same time has a 14.4% lower mean energy use value compared with a solution that is compliant with a recent construction standard (ASHRAE 90.1-2016). Less sensitivity to climate uncertainty means greater robustness to climate change whilst maintaining high performance.  2019 The Authors","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:17","2024-02-20 10:23:17","","","","","202","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109378","Architectural design; Structural design; Optimization; Energy efficiency; Sensitivity analysis; Product design; Climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique, optimum R-value settings are identified for the DIMs throughout the year. These optimal R-value settings are selected to maximize energy cost savings when compared to traditional static insulated wall systems. It is found that optimal control settings for DIMs depend on several factors including building design and operation strategies as well as climatic conditions. Moreover, the optimal settings were found to depend on the orientation of exterior walls and well as the climatic conditions. Specifically, the analysis results indicate that north-facing walls are more active and frequently have to change their R-value in order to minimize the office building energy use and cost. When optimally controlled, DIMs could save up to 17% of annual heating and cooling energy costs for US office buildings.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:17","2024-02-20 10:23:17","","305-320","","","154","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.084","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Building materials; Office buildings; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Insulation; Insulating materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a building information modeling (BIM) based building design optimization method is proposed to facilitate designers to optimize their designs and improve buildings' sustainability. A revised particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to search for the trade-off between life cycle costs (LCC) and life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) of building designs. In order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong.

The purpose of using an IFC server is to facilitate collaboration by exchanging Building Information Modeling (BIM) data among construction project participants. However, the large size of IFC files could require several days to upload to the server and cause a time delay in terms of information exchange. For example, with a non-optimized algorithm, it can take several days to import a 111 MB model file into the IFC server and an import failure can occur with large model files that exceeds 300 MB due to the many cycles of iterations in the search and mapping process for IFC entities and object identifiers. Therefore, the authors proposed a new restructuring algorithm and a bulk-loading method in order to import IFC data into the server in a timely manner. The idea of bulk-loading is to presort and group all the IFC instances by IFC class into blocks. As a result, the import time for a 61 MB model required 56 seconds, and a 111 MB office-building model and a 346 MB building model were imported in 2 min 37 sec and 14 min 11 sec, respectively. The experimental result have shown that the import speed was improved by 30 times faster than the previous NoSQL-based approach. Therefore, the proposed method is anticipated to enable efficient information exchange among project participants in future BIM projects.  2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:17","2024-02-20 10:23:17","","4930-4939","","12","22","","KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12205-017-1977-8","Architectural design; Structural design; Information theory; Office buildings; Information dissemination; Loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It reports on the entire process, from establishing the characteristics of the existing building, carrying out design simulations, documenting the off- site manufacture and on-site installation, and carrying out instrumental monitoring, occupant studies and performance evaluation. Multi-objective optimisation is used throughout the process, for establishing the characteristics of the building before the retrofit, conducting the design simulations, and evaluating the success of the completed retrofit. Building physics parameters before and after retrofit are evaluated in an innovative way through simulation of dynamic heating tests with calibrated models, and the method can be used as quality control measure in future retrofit programmes. New insights are provided into retrofit economics in the context of occupants health and wellbeing improvements. The wide scope of the lessons learnt can be instrumental in the creation of continuing professional development programmes, university courses, and public education that raises awareness and demand.

The heat exchanger core geometry is one of the key factors that affect the overall performance of a heat recovery system. To better guide the development of high performance heat exchangers in building applications, a new analysis method is proposed in this work from the practical application point of view. The objective of the new optimization method is: at any given mass flow rate, temperature difference and desired heat recovery effectiveness, to minimize the material cost at a specified fan energy use, or alternatively, to minimize the fan energy use at a given material cost. Different duct geometries are analyzed together with the classical j/. f factor method: equilateral triangle (Tri), circular (Cyl), square (Squ), rectangle with aspect ratio 1/2 (Rec(1/2)), 1/4 (Rec(1/4)), and 1/8 (Rec(1/8)). A novel channel structure named cross-corrugated triangular (CCT) duct is also considered for comparison. From the energy saving point of view, under the same hydraulic diameter, the pumping power requirements for Rec(1/8) are the lowest when compared with the other shapes in the laminar flow region, while the pumping power requirements for CCT duct are the highest, indicating larger energy consumptions when using such structure. Conversely, with a specified fan power consumption, the required total surface area of Rec(1/8) are the smallest, which means that a parallel plate channel is the best geometry from the material saving point of view. By employing this method, the manufacturing and operating cost can be considered synthetically for achieving an optimal design. The proposed method can be used to select target-oriented high performance heat recovery core geometry for desired heat recovery performance, resulting in reduced space, weight, support structure, energy requirement and lifetime cost.  2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:23:18","2024-02-20 10:23:18","","364-372","","","129","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.024","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Costs; Geometry; Aspect ratio; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Air conditioning; Heat exchangers; Waste heat; Ducts; Laminar flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, although a number of methods have been proposed over the last 15 years for the system-level reliability-based design optimization of building systems subject to stochastic excitation, few have treated problems characterized by more than a handful of design variables. This limits their applicability to practical problems of interest, such as the design optimization of high-rise buildings. To overcome this limitation, a simulation-based method is proposed in this work that is capable of solving reliability-based design optimization problems characterized by high-dimensional design variable vectors while considering system-level performance constraints. The framework is based on approximately decoupling the reliability analysis from the optimization loop through the definition of a system-level subproblem that can be fully defined from the results of a single simulation carried out in the current design point.

However, design choices based solely on reducing operational energy use can significantly increase a building's embodied energy and Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use, because there is a trade-off between embodied and operational energy. This article presents a case study in which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the effects of various EEMs on the aforementioned trade-off. Optimal solution(s) for six different building shapes (rectangular, H-, U-, L-, T- and cross-shaped) based on two sets of EEMs were investigated and compared. The first set of EEMs consisted of EEMs that can be implemented or modified during the early design phase, such as the building's shape, orientation, Window to Wall Ratio (WWR), and constituent materials. The second set comprised EEMs that can be implemented later in the design phase (i.e. EEMs relating to the constituent materials). The LCE reductions achieved by finding optimal solutions for EEMs in the first set (ranged from 2175.2 to 3803.8 GJ) were significantly (over 5 times) higher than those achieved for the second set (ranged from 418.6 to 625.6 GJ) for all building shapes. Moreover, LCE use for pre-optimization building designs varied significantly with building shape. However, after optimization, the differences in LCE use between the optimal solutions of different building shapes were modest. This means that designers and construction companies can select building shapes based on customer requirements, but also highlights the importance of using multi-objective optimization during early design process to identify optimal combinations of EEMs that minimize LCE use.  2018","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:19","2024-02-20 10:23:19","","283-296","","","183","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.11.026","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; Life cycle; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Construction industry; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, in current building practice, a lot of material is wasted, because load-bearing structures are often grossly overdimensioned. Numerical optimization tools have the potential to reduce the consumption of structural materials, but the lack of customized algorithms prohibits their use in daily design practice. This is because real-life structural optimization problems are complex, involving both discrete and continuous design variables as well as large numbers of building code constraints. In the literature, such problems are usually solved using metaheuristic (often genetic) algorithms, although gradient-based algorithms are better suited for continuous design variables. In this article, a new hybrid gradient-based/metaheuristic algorithm is proposed. It combines gradient-based and metaheuristic methods in a nested approach, exploiting the strengths of both: the ability to handle discrete design variables and fast convergence in terms of continuous design variables.

However, each application requires a design tailored to building's specifications. This paper proposes a complete approach for designing TC glaze based on building energy simulation starting from the production of thin thermochromic layers and the measurements of their optical properties by means of a customized spectrophotometer. The main focus of this work is to identify the optimal TC optical response that minimises the building energy consumption. Energy simulations have been performed for a virtual mock-up set at two locations with different climates, Italy and Poland. A set of profiles, each one determining thermochromic properties in terms of switching temperature, range of solar transmittance and transition speed, have been created with a fine step of temperature (2 C) and used to simulate different scenarios. The outcome of the optimization provided the optimal properties to achieve the right balance between cooling energy reduction and heating energy increase due to the application of the thermochromic layer, in comparison to a standard clear glass. The fine step in switching temperature allowed to accurately estimate the subtle differences for the two different climates (25 C Italy, 2426 C Poland). The highest impact has been found for the Italian location with a maximum reduction of total energy consumption of 22.8%. This was achieved with a thermochromic switching at 25 C, with fast transition and range of transmittance between 0.1 (switched state) and 0.5 (normal state), which is a not extreme behaviour.  2021 The Authors","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:19","2024-02-20 10:23:19","","14-25","","","216","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.01.013","Architectural design; Structural design; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Glazes; Optical properties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a mono- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is coupled with EnergyPlus building energy simulation software to find a set of non-dominated solutions to enhance the building energy performance. To evaluate the capability and effectiveness of the approach, the developed method is applied to a single room model, and the effect of building architectural parameters including, the building orientation, the shading overhang specifications, the window size, and the glazing and the wall material properties on the building energy consumption are studied in four major climatic regions of Iran. In the optimization section, mono-criterion and multi-criteria optimization analyses of the annual cooling, heating, and lighting electricity consumption are examined to understand interactions between the objective functions and to minimize the annual total building energy demand. The achieved optimum solutions from the multi-objective optimization process are also reported as Pareto optimal fronts. Finally, the result of multi-criteria minimization is compared with the mono-criterion ones. The results of the triple-objective optimization problem point out that for our typical model, the annual cooling electricity decreases about 19.8-33.3%; while the annual heating and lighting ones increase 1.7-4.8% and 0.5-2.6%, respectively, in comparison to the baseline model for four diverse climatic regions of Iran. In addition, the optimum design leads to 1.6-11.3% diminution of the total annual building electricity demand. The proposed optimization method shows a powerful and useful tool that can save time while searching for the optimal solutions with conflicting objective functions; therefore facilitate decision making in early phases of a building design in order to enhance its energy efficiency.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:23:19","2024-02-20 10:23:19","","293-303","","","170","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.141","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Lighting; MATLAB; Electric power utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this research is to demonstrate the application of a novel Passive Performance Optimization Framework (PPOF) to improve the performance of daylighting, solar control, and natural ventilation strategies in the early design stages of architectural projects. The PPOF is executed through a novel, simulation-based parametric modeling workflow capable of optimizing building geometry, building orientation, fenestration configurations, and other building parameters in response to program requirements, site-specific building adjacencies, and climate-based daylighting and whole-building energy use performance metrics. The applicability of the workflow is quantified by comparing results from the workflow to an ASHRAE 90.1 compliant reference model for four different climate zones, incorporating real sites and urban overshadowing conditions. Results show that the PPOF can deliver between a 4% and 17% reduction in Energy Use Intensity (EUI) while simultaneously improving daylighting performance by between 27% and 65% depending on the local site and climatic conditions.

Some previous methods have been proposed for predicting building energy loads using traditional machine learning methods. However, these traditional methods suffer from overfitting problems, which leads to inaccurate prediction results. To achieve high accuracy results, an ensemble learning approach is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach uses an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to avoid overfitting problems and builds an efficient prediction model. An extensive experiment is conducted on a selected dataset of residential building designs to evaluate the proposed approach. The dataset consists of 768 samples of eight input attributes (overall height, relative compactness, wall area, surface area, roof area, glazing area distribution, glazing area, and orientation) and two output responses (cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL)). The experimental results prove that the proposed approach achieves the highest prediction performance, which will help building managers and engineers make better decisions regarding building energy loads.  2013 IEEE.","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:19","2024-02-20 10:23:19","","48328-48338","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909470","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Learning systems; Glazes; Housing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, in exact optimization models, only energy systems are considered, whereas envelope components are neglected. When considering both, heuristics are commonly used, which do not guarantee optimal or close to optimal results. Thus, this paper presents the governing equations, validation and exemplary usage of a building model suitable for exact optimization problems. The developed model simultaneously considers energy systems and building envelopes. It is based on ISO 13790 and validated according to ASHRAE 140 and further compared to a more detailed model. The findings show that the developed model largely complies with the ASHRAE requirements and is able to assess buildings dynamic behavior regarding indoor air temperatures as well as hourly, peak load, and annual heating loads. The simultaneous optimization of energy system and envelope is further demonstrated analyzing retrofitting options of a residential building. We consider solely installing additional PV units, modernizing the building envelope according to German regulations and an optimization without constraints regarding building envelope and energy system. The results indicate that installing additional PV units can moderately reduce total costs and CO2 emissions. The envelope modernization according to governmental regulations leads to largely increased costs at lower emissions, whereas the unconstrained optimization is able to simultaneously achieve significant cost and CO2 emission advantages.  2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:20","2024-02-20 10:23:20","","1-15","","","185","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.049","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Integer programming; Energy conservation; Solar buildings; Retrofitting; Housing; Energy conversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the design stage, the optimal configuration can be achieved through matching the capacity to load as closely as possible across the full-load profile. However, in spite of the fact that current literature offers practical recommendations, a systematic method to optimize the configuration of multiple-chiller plants is lacking. Due to the lack of accurate information at the design stage and only limited knowledge of the eventual realization it is hard to predict the building's cooling load. Moreover, there is no operational data to predict the system performance. Both explain the existence of uncertainty in the HVAC plant design process. This paper, therefore, proposes a strategy to optimize the configuration of multiple-chiller plants, which takes account of the load side uncertainty as well as the COP uncertainty and selects the optimal configuration through a life-cycle analysis. Both the load side uncertainty and the COP uncertainty are quantified using statistical distributions. To facilitate applications, the distributions of the cooling load profile of different types of buildings under different weather conditions are investigated and are classified into four categories, and the optimal configuration schemes under each type of cooling load distribution are analyzed and summarized in a tabulated form.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:20","2024-02-20 10:23:20","","684-697","","","158","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.040","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; HVAC; Uncertainty analysis; Cooling systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addressing these parameters, building life-cycle analyses are needed, not only to reduce energy consumption, but also to encourage the use of renewable materials. Other priorities are building maintenance and construction material management at the end of the useful life of the building. The use of wooden facades is not very common in Spain. In this study, its energy efficiency is assessed against Spanish Government Regulations, through the Building Technical Code. Hence, this analysis of wooden facades examines their influence on the thermal behavior of the whole building, considering both material properties and structural design, focused on the exterior cladding or protective layer.

The proposed method is based on the framework of topology optimization incorporated with three effective mechanisms favoring the building blocks of associated optimization problems. Conventionally, the topology optimization of antenna structures discretizes a design space into uniform and rectangular pixels. However, the defining length of the resultant building blocks is so large that the problem difficulty arises; furthermore, the order of the building blocks becomes extremely high, so genetic algorithms (GAs) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) are not more efficient than the random search algorithm. In order to form tight linkage groups of building blocks, this paper proposes a novel approach to handle the design details. In particular, a nonuniform discretization is adopted to discretize the design space, and the initialization of GAs is assigned as orthogonal arrays (OAs) instead of a randomized population; moreover, the control map of GAs is constructed by ensuring the schema growth based on the generalized schema theorem. By using the proposed method, two internal antennas are thus successfully developed. The simulated and measured results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional topology optimization.  2015 Yen-Sheng Chen.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:22","2024-02-20 10:23:22","","","","","2015","","International Journal of Antennas and Propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\BD65C2VC\Chen - 2015 - A building-block favoring method for the topology .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/206243","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Structural optimization; Topology; Population statistics; Antenna arrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Africa, and Tanzania in particular, the energy demand for office building is increasing annually as a result of urbanisation, population growth and economic growth. Reducing office buildings ever-escalating energy use is a critical objective requiring scholarly attention. To contribute to achieving that objective, this study compared the energy performance of 2 green and 15 non-green office buildings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The buildings were sampled purposively. The buildings consumption patterns were studied by examining their electricity bills over a five-year period (20152019). The buildings energy consumption data and elements of their designs were analysed using multiple regression models. The study examined four building sets (green buildings, non-green buildings with maximal glazing, non-green buildings with minimal glazing and traditional office buildings). The results indicate that the traditional office buildings, which contained the most climate-responsive design elements of the building types examined, consumed less energy than green-certified office buildings. The modern office buildings with minimal and maximal glass facades consumed the most energy. The buildings with single-split HVAC systems consumed less energy than those with multi/central systems. The study concluded that building classifications and HVAC type are the most significant predictors of energy use, followed by window-to-wall ratio. As East Africa urbanises rapidly, these findings will provide architects, engineers, property managers and policymakers with research-based, real-life data that are specific to their context. Those data can help enhance the performance of green and non-green buildings during their design and operation phases. The study recommends adopting a design strategy that considers both climatic and technical factors in order to optimise building design decisions to lower buildings energy use.  2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023","2024-02-20 10:23:24","2024-02-20 10:23:24","","","","","293","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113202","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Regression analysis; Energy utilization; Glazes; Population statistics; Climate control; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In existing research, the reliability of building form optimization, the influence of uncertainties caused by the design procedures, and the influence of individual uncertain parameters have yet to be thoroughly explored, and thus should be better addressed. In this study, a reliability analysis is conducted on an energy-based form optimization of office buildings under uncertainties in the envelope and occupancy parameters. An optimization process involving Rhinoceros, EnergyPlus, and the genetic algorithm is first implemented. Then, parametric studies of 644 configurations involving 4 cities in different climates and 3 form variables are conducted on a medium-sized office building. The results indicate that the uncertainties in the input parameters can lead to major unreliability of the optimization results, including reductions up to 13% in energy saving achieved by optimization, decreases up to 10% in energy efficiency compared with the results before optimization, and large deviations in the optimized forms. Moreover, it was found that the uncertainty in the visual transmittance of windows is the most significant cause for the unreliability, followed by the U-value of walls, whereas the uncertainties in the occupant density and occupant schedule have a limited influence. It was also found that the impacts vary by locations and the form variables for optimization. Finally, a stochastic optimization method was raised to acquire the overall optimal design under the presence of uncertainties that reduces the risk of getting very poor performance under extreme conditions and decreases the performance dispersion in various scenarios.  2019","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:24","2024-02-20 10:23:24","","","","","209","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109707","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Reliability analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Risk perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A proper sizing of the nZEB systems (e.g. HVAC systems, PV panels, wind turbines and batteries) is essential for achieving the desirable level of thermal comfort, energy balance and grid dependence. Parameter uncertainty, component degradation and maintenance are three crucial factors affecting the nZEB system performances and should be systematically considered in system sizing. Until now, there are some uncertainty-based design methods been developed, but most of the existing studies neglect component degradation and maintenance. Due to the complex impacts of degradation and maintenance, proper sizing of nZEB systems considering multiple criteria (i.e. thermal comfort, energy balance and grid dependence) is still a great challenge. This paper, therefore, proposes a robust design method of nZEB systems using genetic algorithm (GA) which takes into account the parameter uncertainty, component degradation and maintenance. The nZEB life-cycle cost is used as the fitness function, and the user performance requirements on thermal comfort, energy balance and grid dependence are defined as three constraints. This study can help improve the designers understanding of the impacts of uncertainty, degradation, and maintenance on the nZEB life-cycle performances. The proposed method is effective in minimizing the nZEB life-cycle cost through designing the robust optimal nZEB systems sizes and planning the optimal maintenance scheme, meanwhile satisfying the user specified constraints on thermal comfort, energy balance, and grid dependence during the whole service life.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:24","2024-02-20 10:23:24","","905-919","","","163","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.183","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Costs; Thermal comfort; Zero energy buildings; Maintenance; Energy balance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the extensive use of glass facade has allowed these buildings to harness daylight to light up the building interior, it has also allowed substantial solar energy to enter and heat up the building. This is especially critical in hot and humid tropical regions, where reducing solar heat gain, while minimizing heat loss are equally important. The evaluation of glass performance is often conducted using active measurement, which make use of known radiant source. However, this type of setup cannot be applied for testing under non-controlled weather. Though a passive test procedure can be conducted under actual weather conditions using the outdoor test chamber, it is not suitable for a large-scale testing and fast on-site characterization. In addition, this test is limited to the fabricated glazing and thus could not predict potential issues in the design stage. Advances in simulation techniques have enabled building professionals to evaluate the glass facade of a building at the design phase. However, the typical simulation tools are unable to integrate the high performance glazing description, which is generated thanks to advances in coating technology, using the existing glass models. Furthermore, these tools are often lack of local weather models that plays an important role in accurately assess the solar heat gain admitted into the building. This paper provides useful information on different high performance glass facades and assesses their applicability for green building in a tropical country like Singapore. The research effort encompasses an improvement in the methodology used to predict solar irradiance through building glass that incorporates seamlessly the advanced glass models into the solar irradiance simulation. In addition, this will show how to effectively estimate the actual sky behavior via a measured data-based optimization process. A comparison of the simulation results with the measurements from an outdoor climatic test chamber under tropical climate will be performed. An assessment based on the typical glass performance metrics (e.g. U-value and Solar-Factor) together with measured energy savings obtained with the use of different high performance glass facade compared to clear float glass as a control will also be presented.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:24","2024-02-20 10:23:24","","195-203","","","157","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.009","Architectural design; Structural design; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Tropics; Glazes; Solar radiation; Climate models; Urban growth; Glass; Testing; Passive solar; Ray tracing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A bi-objective optimization method using GenOpt and its implementation of a Hooke Jeeves and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is demonstrated that investigates how building enclosure design influences the above objectives. Thermal performance was evaluated by how heat transfer across enclosure elements impacts hourly heating and cooling loads. Lighting performance was evaluated based on the frequency and magnitude at which daylight levels, during occupied hours, deviate from a desired target illuminance range. A single-zone classroom design in Charlotte, NC was optimized for north, south, east, and west orientations. For each orientation, a Pareto front was approximated to help evaluate trade-offs between thermal and daylighting objectives. Results show that for the south, east, and west orientations, thermal and daylighting objectives are not in strong conflict, however, for the north orientation there is a more marked conflict between these objectives.  2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:24","2024-02-20 10:23:24","","591-602","","","92","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.03.039","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Multiobjective optimization; Heat transfer; Daylighting; Enclosures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Active tuned mass damper system is one of these devices, which is a combination of a passive tuned mass damper system and an actuator to produce a control force. The main objective of this paper is to present a practical procedure for both deterministic and probabilistic design of the active tuned mass damper control system using multi-objective genetic algorithms to mitigate high-rise building responses. For this purpose, extensive numerical analyses have been performed, and optimal robust results of the active tuned mass damper design parameters with their effectiveness in reducing the example building responses have been presented. Uncertainties, which may exist in the system, have been taken into account using a robust design optimization procedure. The stiffness matrix and damping ratio of the building are considered as uncertain random variables; and using the well-known beta distribution, 50 pairs of these variables are generated. This resulted in 50 buildings with different stiffness matrices and damping ratios. These simulated buildings are used to evaluate robust optimal values of the active tuned mass damper design parameters. Four non-commensurable objective functions, namely maximum displacement, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration of each floor of the building, and active control force produced by the actuator are considered, and a fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm approach is used to find a set of pareto-optimal solutions.

A simulation-based optimization","Solar Energy","","0038092X","10.1016/j.solener.2021.02.024","","The use of phase change materials (PCMs) in the building envelope has emerged as an attractive passive design strategy that can be used to improve the energy performance of buildings. This paper discusses the effect of using PCMs on the thermal performance of shaded and unshaded lightweight structures in different Algerian climatic zones. A simulation-based optimization was carried out by coupling EnergyPlus and GenOpt tool, to determine the optimum melting temperature of PCM when integrated into the building envelope. Results show that the shaded building with PCM is a preferred design model in majority of Algerian climates when it is free floating. The annual percentage of thermal comfort ranges between 44.13% and 59.11% in cities where the PCMs showed positive potential. Furthermore, the optimization results show that the PCMs achieved a modest cooling energy saving for mechanically-ventilated buildings in summer, especially in hot-dry climate with optimal melting points equal to or close to 28 C. The control of solar heat gain by using shading devices is critical to enhance the thermal performance in summer. In winter, the PCMs achieved a noticeable reduction in the heating energy requirements where it reached a maximum of 63.23% in the city of Tamanrasset. The shading device is not recommended during the winter because it hinders the use of solar radiation for passive heating. During this season, the optimal melting points of PCMs are generally bounded between 18.50 C and 21.25 C. When considering both periods, the most advantageous design varies from climatic zone to another.  2021 International Solar Energy Society","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:25","2024-02-20 10:23:25","","375-389","","","217","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.02.024","Architectural design; Structural design; Optimization; Energy efficiency; Solar buildings; Melting point; Phase change materials; Climate models; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These parameters were calculated by using different methods in SALib. Through the verification and analysis of the sensitive result, the applicability of the CWS and DMIM-delta was confirmed. Among the design parameters involved in this study, the sum of the sensitive values of S-D, S-N and S-A exceeds 60% in each performance label, and the sum of the sensitive values of WWR_S and WWR_N exceeds 20%. The performance design of envelope enclosure in this area requires applying reasonable shading components and appropriate optimisation of the North and South of WWR.

It is critical to enhancing building energy efficiency for sustainable development. The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems account for about half of the energy consumption in commercial buildings. For large commercial buildings, central chiller plants are typically used to provide chilled water for space cooling and consume lots of energy. This study evaluates the impacts of different chiller design and their operation strategy on the energy performance of central chiller plants. A case study is conducted using an office building located in Beijing, China. Feasible chiller combinations are studied based on 13 available chillers with different capacities. Four control strategies are explored, including three sequencing control strategies based on weekly, daily, and hourly maximum cooling loads and one optimal control strategy. A building energy model is created using DeST to simulate the hourly cooling load of the office building, and calibrated using the measured data. An integration model has been developed in MATLAB scripts to calculate the annual energy consumption of the chillers for each chiller design under each control strategy. The results indicate that it is essential to control the chiller plant hourly; however, the optimal control may not be necessary. It is not good to select the chillers with all the same capacity. The capacity of the chillers should be slightly different to provide flexibility for control. The design of the chiller combination is essential in the design stage. When bad combinations of chillers were designed, the performance of the chiller plant may be low even with optimization control strategies.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:28","2024-02-20 10:23:28","","","","","222","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110100","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Air conditioning; MATLAB; Cooling; Cooling systems; Optimal control systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is, therefore, necessary to develop new decision-making tools for evaluating the sustainability of campus buildings. Since university campuses typically comprise a broad variety of building types, standardized evaluation methods and tools, such as Green BIM, are needed. Green BIM (Building Information Modeling) emphasizes the importance and role of BIM technology in the design and construction of green buildings, providing a standardized framework for the decision-making process, and methods for improving the green performance of buildings. Methods: This study develops a method based on the Green BIM framework, using BIM architecture to analyse building performance, and the Assessment Standard for Green Building (GB/T 50378-2019) standard to establish benchmark values for evaluation, and project objectives. The method is evaluated on three examples of the most representative university buildings in northern China. The goal is to understand common denominators and differences between different types of campus buildings, in terms of green building indicators, that are important to consider in the early design stages of campus building complexes. Results: In this study, a library is used as a case study to demonstrate the tools for evaluating green performance. The study optimizes green performance from five aspects: surrounding environment, function layout, envelope performance and system transformation, and management measures improvement. The results show that this optimization scheme can achieve reductions of the annual loads of about 47.4%, in line with the national energy efficiency standards for public buildings. In particular, the heating load was reduced by 59.1%, and the cooling load reduced by 21.5%. Conclusion: A comprehensive approach, combining the aspects of planning, building design, system design, energy management, and energy conservation planning, is required to improve the green performance of university buildings to meet the goals. In the future, it will be further necessary to perform data mining of energy consumption patterns, and continue energy retrofitting of existing buildings and energy systems, to achieve the goal of green and low-carbon campuses.  2022, The Author(s).","2022","2024-02-20 10:23:30","2024-02-20 10:23:30","","","","1","12","","Energy, Sustainability and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13705-022-00341-9","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Sustainable development; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; College buildings; Data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building Information Modelling (BIM), as emerging technology, bears promise to support processes integration thus enabling life-cycle management of buildings. BIM model serves as a joint knowledge database where data transfer between various models is possible; thereby enabling follow up studies, such as cost, thermal and structural analysis. Adoption of BIM to BEM (building energy modelling) approach is particularly interesting for optimisation of industrial facilities. Multiple layers of interacting complex systems (building, services and machine floor layout) require careful modelling and control of geometry in terms of collisions, various adaptions due to the short product-life-cycles, as well as integrated energy performance analysis along interacting systems. This paper explores the potentials and deficits of the modelling, analysis and optimisation of energy-efficient industrial buildings using BIM to BEM methodology, by means of case study research of two industrial facilities. Varying needs concerning the Level of Development and semantic differences in the modelling procedures of part-taking disciplines (architecture, structural engineering or analysis) were identified as problems; as well as time pressure as one of the main reasons for defects of building models. The identified deficits represent various types of uncertainties related to the integrated energy modelling, as BIM to BEM can be referred to. We conclude that as a first step of integrated modelling, an uncertainty-analysis should be carried out, and strategies how to deal with these developed. In order to minimise BIM to BEM uncertainties, not only interoperability issues of the software has to be improved (modelling uncertainty), but moreover, the redefinition of the design process and enhancement of individual capabilities is necessary (process uncertainty).  2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:30","2024-02-20 10:23:30","","953-963","","","68","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.02.009","Architectural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; Information theory; Office buildings; Boundary element method; Uncertainty analysis; Data transfer; Industrial research; Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High cost of the floor elements is a challenge, and the timber sector is under substantial pressure to find more economical solutions without weakening otherwise favourable environmental performance. The range of technical timber-based materials and components, structural typologies, overlays and ceiling systems represent an immense solution space when searching for a competitive design for a specific building application. Finding the optimum solution requires a computational procedure. In this study a recent development for the accounting of manufacturing resources for timber elements is utilized to build an optimization framework for cost and ECO2 minimisation of timber floor elements finalized at the factory gate. The design of the element is formulated as a discrete optimization problem which is solved by a mixed-integer sequential linearization procedure. Various material combinations and constraint combinations are treated. The optimization framework provides a tool for rapid design exploration that can be used in timber floor design situations. The results of the calculations carried out in this study provide insight on the general trends of optimum floor elements. The optimization model is used to analyse the characteristics of the optimum designs, and a comparison between the current and the proposed method for the second generation of Eurocode 5 is chosen as a vehicle for demonstrating achievable implications.  2021 The Authors","2022","2024-02-20 10:23:30","2024-02-20 10:23:30","","","","","252","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113485","Architectural design; Carbon; Floors; Structural design; Emission control; Codes (standards); Integer programming; Timber; Environmental management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing an energy prediction model with high accuracy is considered one of the most effective approach to understanding building energy efficiency. Therefore, various studies have developed diverse models for predicting building energy consumption focused on the current building stock. However, to ensure future buildings are constructed to be more energy efficient, it is essential to consider energy efficiency at the design stage. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are considered the most contemporary and best method for prediction, and these algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), among others) have gained much attention in the field of energy prediction. However, no study has explored the application of hyper parameter tuning and feature selection methods in developing a design stage Machine Learning (ML) energy predictive model. In this research, nine machine learning classification-based algorithms were compared for energy performance assessment at the design stage of residential buildings. Additionally, feature selection and hyper parameter tunning were implemented. The result shows that it is possible to develop a high performing ML model for building energy use prediction at the design stage. Furthermore, Gradient Boosting (GB) outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 0.67 for predicting building energy performance.  2021 International Energy Initiative","2022","2024-02-20 10:23:31","2024-02-20 10:23:31","","12-25","","","66","","Energy for Sustainable Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2021.11.002","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Energy utilization; Decision trees; Feature Selection; Adaptive boosting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the incorporation of half-open spaces into the ground corners of high-rise buildings is accomplished by slightly modifying the building morphology as a feasible solution. A unified procedure is proposed via a combined framework of parametric CFD study and multivariable regression analysis to optimize the half-open space design for improving ventilation performance and air quality. The influences of four design parameters on wind flow characteristics are investigated, including (i) the building height, (ii) the width of street canyon, (iii) the height of half-open space, and (iv) the width of half-open space. Using the results from this combined framework, CFD simulations are then extended to inspect the effectiveness of merging optimized half-open space layouts into high-rise buildings as the deterministic analysis in a realistic case study. Both CFD simulations are validated with the wind tunnel data for a generic urban array and on-site measurements for a realistic case study. The predictions are discussed to evaluate the outcomes of urban breathability and air pollutant dispersion by the indices of air change per hour (ACH) and purging flow rate (PFR). The incorporation of optimized half-open spaces into constructions can greatly improve urban ventilation and air pollutant dispersion in the pedestrian pathway layer. To complete the combined framework for a realistic high-rise urban area, the optimized half-open space design can increase ACH* and PFR by 75% and 57%, respectively, in the pedestrian pathway layer, as compared to the case of original half-open space design. This strategy relies on the database formulated from the CFD results of varied building morphologies in the generic urban array to realize the optimized design in a more effective and time-saving manner when applying to realistic cases.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:31","2024-02-20 10:23:31","","","","","44","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102975","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind tunnels; Regression analysis; Ventilation; Urban growth; Computational fluid dynamics; Air quality; Morphology; Quality control; Purging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is achieved by first reviewing and analyzing LCA integration methods during the early design stages, emphasizing parametric methods. Second, studying the situation of LCA and energy efficiency in Egypt through publications, building codes, and residential building construction specifications.

Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are among the most significant contributors to global primary energy consumption and carbon gas emissions. Furthermore, HVAC energy demand is expected to rise in the future. Therefore, advancements in HVAC systems performance and design would be critical for mitigating worldwide energy and environmental concerns. To make such advancements, energy modeling and model predictive control (MPC) play an imperative role in designing and operating HVAC systems effectively. Building energy simulations and analysis techniques effectively implement HVAC control schemes in the building system design and operation phases, and thus provide quantitative insights into the behaviors of the HVAC energy flow for architects and engineers. Extensive research and advanced HVAC modeling/control techniques have emerged to provide better solutions in response to the issues. This study reviews building energy modeling techniques and state-of-the-art updates of MPC in HVAC applications based on the most recent research articles (e.g., from MDPIs and Elseviers databases). For the review process, the investigation of relevant keywords and context-based collected data is first carried out to overview their frequency and distribution comprehensively. Then, this review study narrows the topic selection and search scopes to focus on relevant research papers and extract relevant information and outcomes. Finally, a systematic review approach is adopted based on the collected review and research papers to overview the advancements in building system modeling and MPC technologies. This study reveals that advanced building energy modeling is crucial in implementing the MPC-based control and operation design to reduce building energy consumption and cost.

The computer code is designed to get most of the inputs from the building model in SAP2000, to have minimal manual inputs that define diagrid shell geometry. The code is also built so that the engineer evaluates the optimum diagrid geometry for any rectangular plan building, which is modeled in SAP2000 software. Three different buildings, which consist of 30, 60, and 90 stories, are modeled in SAP2000 without diagrid shells on facades. Based on these models, the diagrid shell geometries are analyzed for both uniform angle (UA) and varying angle (VA) geometries. A different geometry approach to VA models is proposed, consisting of symmetry and continuum for the load distribution and asymmetry, achieving minimal weight. In order to evaluate the optimum VA topology, GA, is used. Predetermined dead, live, and wind loads are applied to the models based on minimum design loads according to American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7-10, with corresponding load factors to be able to get more realistic results. Based on the resultant module diagonal cross-sectional areas, an algorithm is developed and encoded in order to determine minimum required pipe section sizes according to buckling design of compression members as stated in American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 360-10, to give the engineer an approximate idea of what the required sections should be. Additionally, the feasibility of the optimum models is compared by complexity index parameters. The results of the analyses show that optimum VA models are more efficient than UA models concerning the diagrid shell's total weight. However, UA models are more feasible, according to complexity index values. 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:35","2024-03-19 07:48:50","","","","9","30","","Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GRT54TWI\Orhan and Takin - 2021 - Automated topology design of high-rise diagrid bui.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tal.1853","Architectural design; Codes (symbols); Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithms; Geometry; Structural optimization; Topology; Shells (structures); MATLAB; Application programming interfaces (API); 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 1_Topology; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Part of building (Diagrid)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, a good number of rebars are required by a design code, particularly at member connections. As such, rebar clashes (i.e., collisions and congestions) would be inevitable. It would be impractical, labor-intensive, and error-prone to avoid all possible clashes manually or even using standard design software. The building information modeling (BIM) technology has been utilized by the present architecture, engineering, and construction (ACE) industry for clash-free rebar designs. However, most existing BIM-based approaches offer the clash resolution strategy for moving components with an optimization algorithm, and are only applicable to the RC structures with regular shapes. In particular, the optimized path of rebars cannot be adjusted to avoid the obstacles, thus limiting the practical applications. Furthermore, most existing studies lack the learning from design code and constructibility constraints to realize automatic and intelligent arrangement and adjustment of rebars for avoiding the obstacles encountered in complex RC joints and frame structures. Considering these shortcomings, the authors have recently proposed an immediate reward-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system with BIM, towards automatic clash-free rebar designs of RC joints without clashes. However, as the immediate reward is required in the MARL system for guiding the learning of a rebar design, it will not succeed in clash-free rebar designs of complex RC structures where immediate reward is often unavailable. In this study, this study further extends the previous work with Q-learning (a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm) for more realistic path planning considering both immediate and delayed rewards in clash-free rebar designs for real-world RC structures. In particular, the rebar design problem is treated as a path-planning problem of multi-agent system, where each rebar is deemed as an intelligence reinforcement learning agent. Next, by employing the Q-learning as the reinforcement learning engine, the particular form of state, action, and immediate and delayed rewards for the reinforcement MARL for automatic rebar designs considering more actual constructible constraints and design codes can be developed. Comprehensive experiments on three typical beam-column joints and a two-story RC building frame were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The study results of paths of rebar designs, success rates, and average time confirm that the proposed framework with MARL and BIM is effective and efficient.  2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:35","2024-02-20 10:23:35","","","","","112","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\4ZBSXBA9\Liu et al. - 2020 - Towards automated clash resolution of reinforcing .pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103062","Architectural design; Codes (symbols); Structural design; Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement learning; Learning algorithms; Multi agent systems; Motion planning; Fertilizers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, decisions of design options and their technical measures are mainly reduced to an instantaneously assessed criterion (i.e. energy efficiency) within the sustainability assessment of buildings. Due to criteria interdependency, the current linear applied approach used in building certification neglects criteria trade-offs and is therefore only partly suitable for holistic building improvement processes. In order to fulfil stakeholder interests on the one hand and a high sustainability performance on the other, it is crucial to identify appropriate design measures. Based on the Austrian building certification system OGNI/DGNB, we applied a systemic approach for building sustainability-improvement, using a case study of a public office building in Graz, Austria. The main part of the study describes the important steps required for the systemic optimization of building sustainability. The method applied in this study allows the quantification of the relative influence and the identification of the individual optimization potential of design options on each single assessment criterion. The proposed systemic approach clearly demonstrated the improvement potential of the currently most developed building certification system considering the interdependency between the individual criteria.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:36","2024-02-20 10:23:36","","385-396","","","109","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.09.040","Architectural design; Structural design; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apart from higher pollution emissions due to human activities in densely populated street canyons, stagnated air flow due to closely packed tall buildings means lower dispersion potential. The coupled result leads to frequent reports of high air pollution indexes at street-side stations in Hong Kong. High-density urban morphologies need to be carefully designed to lessen the ill effects of high density urban living. This study addresses the knowledge-gap between planning and design principles and air pollution dispersion potentials in high density cities. The air ventilation assessment for projects in high-density Hong Kong is advanced to include air pollutant dispersion issues. The methods in this study are CFD simulation and parametric study. The SST k.  model is adopted after balancing the accuracy and computational cost in the comparative study. Urban-scale parametric studies are conducted to clarify the effects of urban permeability and building geometries on air pollution dispersion, for both the outdoor pedestrian environment and the indoor environment in the roadside buildings. Given the finite land resources in high-density cities and the numerous planning and design restrictions for development projects, the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is evaluated to optimize the benefits. A real urban case study is finally conducted to demonstrate that the suggested design principles from the parametric study are feasible in the practical high density urban design.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:23:36","2024-02-20 10:23:36","","245-258","","","71","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.10.008","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Urban planning; Computational fluid dynamics; Air quality; Population statistics; Public health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, the focus of environmental performance in buildings has been Operation Energy (OE) requirements, however Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) are changing this. Specifically the study investigates the environmental performance of concrete structures varying design parameters and construction techniques to optimise its embodied energy (EE). These structures are designed in accordance with all relevant Australian codes and standards. The various slab systems investigated include: beam & slab, flat slab and flat plates while concurrently considering the use of conventionally reinforced and post-tensioned construction methods.

It is therefore important to quantify this influence and identify robust designs that have potential to deliver the desired performance under uncertainties. Generally, robust building designs are identified by assessing the performance of multiple design configurations under various uncertainties. When exploring a large design space, this approach becomes computationally expensive and infeasible in practice. Therefore, we propose a simulation framework based on multi-objective optimization and sampling strategies to find robust optimal designs at low computational costs. The genetic algorithm parameters of optimization are fine tuned to further enhance the computational efficiency. Furthermore, a modified fitness function is implemented to use minimax regret robustness method in the optimization loop. The implemented simulation framework can save up to 9499% of computational time compared to full factorial approach, while identifying the same robust designs. 2018, 2018 The Author(s).

Performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) is aimed at improving the life-cycle functionality of wind-sensitive structures, hence could be the very field RDO is tailor-made for. In this paper, we embed PBWE of tall buildings into RDO and tackle some difficulties when integrating them directly. We first formulate an integrated stiffness and vibration control RDO problem, and employ a frequency domain closed-form solution for uncertainty quantification and uncertainty propagation through the excitation-response-performance chain. Then we reveal the multi-objective optimization nature of RDO, and circumvent the difficulties in serviceability loss estimation by replacing scalar total cost with high-dimensional objective vector. Micro multi-objective particle swarm optimization in conjunction with kernel-learning based principle component analysis is employed to solve the corresponding many-objective problem with multiple probabilistic constraints and discrete design variables. The optimization results of CAARC benchmark indicate that we simplify risk-based PBWE of tall buildings from a complex multi-objective decision making process into a relatively easy multi-attribute decision making process. Accordingly, convincing decisions can be made based on the explicit building performance rather than the unreliable loss information.  2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:23:37","2024-03-25 13:47:03","","1-14","","","48","","Structural Safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\2IIHZSC9\Li and Hu - 2014 - Risk design optimization using many-objective evol.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2014.01.002","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Life cycle; Decision making; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Frequency domain analysis; Multiobjective optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Principal component analysis; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 4_MOO (4); 7_Others (not readable); 3_Others (probability of failure RMS); 3_Others (Pf, acceleration); 3_Others (Non-structural element loss)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The double-skin perforated sheet-metal facade, an enclosure composed of sheet metal, air chambers and glass, is an example of this tendency in modern building design. The aim of this research is to study the thermal behavior of the facade taking into account several physical parameters such as, perforation rates, colors and materials, as well as the influence of wind penetration. The study also quantifies the improvements in terms of energy savings that different configurations of these parameters can bring to the building as a whole. First of all, a theoretical model was built in Matlab based on an energy balance of these types of enclosure. The experimental process for validation purposes consisted of monitoring metallic sheets within a range of 0-35% (perforation rates), black-white (colors) and galvanized steel-aluminum (materials) in a large-scale test campaign. Excellent agreement was achieved between the outputs from the above-mentioned numerical model and the test campaign, sufficient for its validation. The behavior of different configurations will be described in a further paper, addressing their influence on cooling, heating and lighting loads in the building, with an Energyplus model, which will be also validated with our theoretical model. Finally, additional parameters such as air-space width and location in the various climate zones defined for Spain will be carefully studied, for the optimization of design sustainability.  2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2024-02-20 10:23:37","2024-02-20 10:37:34","","50-62","","","82","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.08.007","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Enclosures; Galvanizing; Sheet metal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is very rare to find optimization research on cross disciplines. Buildings optimized for energy use rarely consider building structural optimization. In contrast, a structurally optimized building is rarely optimized for daylighting or energy. Without integrating a different building performance area, the solution found in one area will be a problematic solution in another area. This paper proposes a method to overcome the current limitation of using optimization for a specific domain and extend the use of optimization to cover multi-discipline areas. The paper developed a method to integrate the criteria of several performances into MOO. As a test case, a truss system was selected for maximizing the daylight into the indoor space, maximizing the structure strength and minimizing the system's weight, and the overall material cost. The MOO was able to find several solutions that could satisfy the goals, and the post-MOO process was able to identify the ranking order of the solutions. The main contribution of this paper is developing a method that uses different domain computational simulation tools in the early design stage to find a solution. This optimized solution was not for one specific domain area but a solution that satisfies several building performance areas. This is important so that a designer can be the guide to find a better design solution in the early design stage where design can greatly impact a building's performance.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:38","2024-02-20 10:23:38","","","","","34","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.102056","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Roofs; Trusses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reports on the results of the first step of the research, providing a mapping in terms of structure and contents of the parameters involved in the design of these technologies. Addressed from a holistic point of view, the elements of the system were defined though a qualitative approach: relevant parameters were collected through document analysis, reviewing the state-of-the-art technology through online databases as ScienceDirect, Scopus, MDPI, ResearchGate, and organized according to hierarchy and relevance in the different life cycle stages. As a result, the paper identifies (1) relevant parameters defining the design of Adaptive Building Technologies; (2) materials, processes and concepts specific to the design of these technologies, as compared to conventional building technologies; (3) issues and knowledge gaps to enable successive research phases; (4) specific actions in each life cycle stage for designers and producers to optimize the design of the technology. The mapping graphically and hierarchically organizes the elements of the system within a flexible structure to be implemented and integrated over time, as the technology evolves, to support parametric design and enable alternative design concepts to arise within a cradle-to-cradle perspective.  2019 by the authors.

The application of optimisation techniques requires the design criteria to be quantifiable, which sets the baseline for the application of performance-based designs. Sustainability has become the main driver in the built environment during recent decades, with energy efficiency becoming the foremost design criteria and appropriately quantified. By contrast, the approach taken for fire safety is much simplistic, relying on a series of prescriptions based on material classification and ""pass-fail"" criteria defined in standard fire tests. This results in deficiencies in identification of fire hazards and undermines any attempt at design optimisation. A redefinition of the failure criteria framework based on fundamental understanding of the material behaviour, including the heat transfer controlled processes governing the onset of pyrolysis, can provide a performance-based methodology for the fire safe use of insulation materials in buildings. The different hazards from insulation materials in fire are identified and a set of criteria are defined to identify likely failure modes. A series of highly instrumented large-scale experiments of a construction system involving a common combustible material are referenced to demonstrate the proposed methodology.  2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:39","2024-02-20 10:23:39","","285-297","","","100","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.10.014","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; Fire hazards; Fires; Heat transfer; Thermal insulation; Insulating materials; Pyrolysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the construction of reinforced concrete (RC) structures consumed tremendous amounts of steel reinforcement and concrete, RC structural design optimization for minimal environmental impact has attracted increasing attentions from academics and industry in recent years. Nowadays, new information technologies and computing techniques were increasingly utilized for the sustainable design and optimization of RC structures to maximize energy efficiency, but it still lacks a critical review to summarize the common research themes and highlight the future needs in this field. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to critically review the previous research related to the computational design optimization of RC structures for the minimum environmental impact, with the aim of highlighting the present status and future trends for the advancement of building design optimization. First, the general introduction and background for importance of multidisciplinary detailed design optimization of RC structures are described. Thereafter, a critical review of available research objectives, structural components, optimization strategies, and the use of different computational tools in RC structural design optimization to integrate sustainability in constructional design stage, is provided in this paper. Furthermore, different research trends are analyzed and critically discussed in detail. Potential research directions to better quantify and evaluate the implementation of detailed RC structural design optimization are presented.

Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shape modifications to improve the building's aerodynamic properties. On the other hand, it is well-known that the cross-section geometry has a direct impact in the floor area availability and subsequently in the buildings profitability. Hence, it is of interest for the designers to find the balance between these two design criteria that may require contradictory design strategies. This study proposes a surrogate-based multi-objective optimization framework to tackle this design problem. Closed-form equations provided by the Eurocode are used to obtain the wind-induced responses for several wind directions, seeking to develop an industry-oriented approach. CFD-based surrogates emulate the aerodynamic response of the building cross-section, using as input parameters the cross-section geometry and the wind angle of attack. The definition of the buildings modified plan shapes is done adopting the reduced basis approach, advancing the current strategies currently adopted in aerodynamic optimization of civil engineering structures. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved with both the classical weighted Sum Method and the Weighted Min-Max approach, which enables obtaining the complete Pareto front in both convex and non-convex regions. Two application examples are presented in this study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy, which permits the identification of Pareto optima from which the designer can choose the most adequate design balancing profitability and occupant comfort.

With a focus on the long span building typology, this research employs a MOO approach that uses both finite element structural modeling and building energy simulations simultaneously to generate optimized building shapes that are not constrained to regular, rectilinear geometric configurations. Through a series of case studies that explore performance tradeoffs of enclosed arches and static overhangs in different climates, this paper shows how MOO can yield architecturally expressive, high-performing designs, which makes the process more attractive to designers searching for creative forms. It also provides new insight into specific design responses to various climatic constraints, since optimization that considers both structure and energy can shift best solutions in unexpected ways. Finally, by displaying performance results in terms of embodied and operational energy, this paper presents new data showing how considerations of structural material efficiency compare in magnitude to total building energy usage.

As a result, buildings in those areas consume more energy to maintain a comfortable climate for their inhabitants. In an effort to design net-zero energy building in hot climates, PV possesses the unique advantage of generating electrical energy while protecting the building from solar irradiance. In this work, to form a net-zero energy building (NZEB), renewable resources such as solar and wind available onsite for an existing building have been analyzed in a hot climate location. PV and wind turbines in various configurations are studied to form a NZEB, where PV-only systems offer better performance than Hybrid PV Wind systems, based on net present cost (NPC). The self-shading losses in PV placed on rooftop areas are analyzed by placing parallel arrays of PV modules at various distances in between them. The effect on building cooling load by rooftop PV panels as shading devices is investigated. Furthermore, self-shading losses of PV are compared by the savings in cooling loads using PV as shading. In the case study, 12.3% saving in the cooling load of the building is observed when the building rooftop is completed shaded by PV panels; annual cooling load decreased from 3.417 GWh to 2.996 GWh, while only 1.04% shaded losses are observed for fully shaded (FS) buildings compared to those with no shading (NS), as PV generation decreases from 594.39 kWh/m2 to 588.21 kWh/m2. The net present cost of the project has been decreased from US$4.77 million to US$4.41 million by simply covering the rooftop completely with PV panels, for a net-zero energy building.  2018 by the authors.

In this study, a parametric study based on a validated model was carried out using EnergyPlus to evaluate the impacts of various facade design factors on indoor air temperatures and cooling loads. In particular, the facade performance was evaluated under five different ventilation or air-conditioning scenarios, namely 1) window-closed (WC) and 2) window-open (WO) scenarios for indoor air temperatures, as well as 3) 24-hour air-conditioning (AC), 4) nighttime air-conditioning with daytime closed window (WC + NA), and 5) nighttime air-conditioning with daytime open window (WO + NA) scenarios for cooling loads. It is found that, compared with the worst-performed unshaded facade with full-height clear glass, reducing the facade's window-to-wall ratio (WWR) from 1 to 0.4 could achieve the largest indoor air temperature reductions under both WC and WO scenarios, followed by reducing the glass solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) from 0.82 to 0.47, and by adding a 1.5-m horizontal overhang above the window. For space cooling energy-saving purpose, reducing the facade's WWR from 1 to 0.4 and reducing the SHGC of window glass from 0.82 to 0.47 could achieve the largest cooling load reductions under the AC and WC + NA scenarios respectively. Moreover, window openings could effectively reduce the indoor air temperatures and nighttime cooling loads, as they facilitate heat dissipation during the daytime. In addition, the impacts of window glass and wall insulation on indoor air temperatures and cooling loads were analyzed. The more insulated windows and walls could have adverse effects on indoor thermal comfort and cooling loads if the internal surface temperature of facade becomes higher than its external surface, which could occur during the daytime when the indoor temperature is high under the WC scenario, or at night when the outdoor air temperature drops. For better thermal comfort and energy efficiency, it is thus advisable to conduct an optimization study to find the optimal facade insulation levels for tropical buildings, with considerations on the air-conditioning modes (operation period and set-point), window size and shading, glass SHGC and outdoor weather conditions.  2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:43","2024-02-20 10:23:43","","","","","243","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110972","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Facades; Walls (structural partitions); Air conditioning; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Thermal insulation; Housing; Atmospheric temperature; Glass; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This compels the construction industry to smartly design and effectively construct these buildings to ensure energy performance as per design expectations. However, the research tells a different tale: energy-efficient buildings have performance issues. Among several reasons behind the energy performance gap, occupant behavior is critical. The occupant behavior is dynamic and changes over time under formal and informal influences, but the traditional energy simulation programs assume it as static throughout the occupancy. Effective behavioral interventions can lead to optimized energy use. To find out the energy-saving potential based on simulated modified behavior, this study gathers primary building and occupant data from three energy-efficient office buildings in major cities of Pakistan and categorizes the occupants into high, medium, and low energy consumers. Additionally, agent-based modeling simulates the change in occupant behavior under the direct and indirect interventions over a three-year period. Finally, energy savings are quantified to highlight a 25.4% potential over the simulation period. This is a unique attempt at quantifying the potential impact on energy usage due to behavior modification which will help facility managers to plan and execute necessary interventions and software experts to develop effective tools to model the dynamic usage behavior. This will also help policymakers in devising subtle but effective behavior training strategies to reduce energy usage. Such behavioral retrofitting comes at a much lower cost than the physical or technological retrofit options to achieve the same purpose and this study establishes the foundation for it.  2020 by the authors.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:44","2024-02-20 10:23:44","","","","6","13","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13061480","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Computational methods; Office buildings; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Retrofitting; Autonomous agents; Simulation platform; Consumer behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In pursuit of this goal, this study presents actual scenes through virtual space and introduces a new research concept for analyzing human brain data. The researchers adopted virtual reality technology in a controlled laboratory environment to compose building simulation spaces and created immersive space perceptions in response to different scenarios. Neural signal electroencephalogram (EEG) data were obtained in the simulation space from participants wearing EEG signal acquisition caps. The experiment process was divided into two phases: scene cognition and task performance. Changes in human perception, as measured on physiological, psychological, and work efficiency indexes, were examined in three environments: open natural, semi-open library, and closed basement spaces. Based on a 32-point analysis of the EEGs of 30 subjects, researchers determined four points and one region with the most significant EEG changes after scene switching. Also, by examining the EEG rhythms in the scene cognition experiment phase, the authors identified a coupling relationship between  rhythms and total time to task completion, proving the mechanistic relationship between  rhythms and work efficiency. Finally, this research revealed a correlation between subjective perception and physiological signals by analyzing the relevance of the connection between subjective questionnaire responses and the  rhythms demonstrated in the EEG experiment, and then deducing the mechanism affecting work efficiency as influenced by different environments. The results obtained show that in the context of changes to elements of a building's spatial environment, human work efficiency is most related to the  rhythms at several test points and the right temporal lobe region of the brain. Moreover,  rhythms are closely related to satisfaction with human spatial perception. Therefore, this research provides a more accurate set of reference information for building space design based on occupant satisfaction and physical and mental health. The methods and conclusions demonstrated here can be adopted as feedback for ways of obtaining more realistic information from human brain signals and using those data to optimize architectural space design.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:46","2024-02-20 10:23:46","","","","","224","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110259","Architectural design; Structural design; Efficiency; Virtual reality; Feedback; Physiological models; Brain; Electroencephalography; Signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the material has been used as the primary reinforcement in elements with greater structural responsibility, such as building column-supported slabs. Several dozen buildings have incorporated this new technology, and research is being conducted on how to optimize the design while guaranteeing the required reliability levels. However, in some cases, fibers have not been used as the primary reinforcement in concrete slabs for economic reasons. In most cases, the solution is compared with existing alternatives (traditionally reinforced concrete) considering only the direct material costs and disregarding indirect costs, social aspects, and environmental factors. The building construction sector lacks sustainability rating tools to assess structural components separately (e.g., columns, floors, panels, and facades). This paper presents a new method that can be used to assess the sustainability of concrete slabs by means of a multicriteria decision-making approach including fiber-reinforced concrete.

Evidently, the types of structures have significant effects on the land use, energy demand, and carbon emissions of buildings. This paper presents an extensive review of currently adopted sustainable structural design strategies, thereby emphasizing the need for a comprehensive optimization approach to minimize the buildings carbon footprint. However, a design optimization problem involves hundreds of design variables and requires long computation time. To overcome these issues, a parametric study should be prior conducted to estimate the interrelationships and the influence of structural design variables on the final embodied emissions. In this research, a flat plate building is investigated considering different column spacings, concrete strengths, structural component sizes, detailed reinforcements, and for the application of Reinforced Concrete (RC) and Post-Tensioned (PT) construction techniques. While the most sustainable designs of slab systems are attained with shorter slab spans and thinner slab depths, columns having less longitudinal reinforcement with a moderate rise in dimensions are the best options. Furthermore, the employment of pre-stressed tendons results in a significant decrease in material requirements and related embodied impacts, by 26.333.5% and 26.633.8%, respectively. The outcomes indicated that reduction in a building's self-weight does not necessarily mean a decline in embodied emissions, highlighting the trade-offs between material saving and material carbon intensiveness in the decisions towards sustainable design and construction.  2021","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:46","2024-03-19 12:04:07","","","","","315","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\XIMNTFIJ\Trinh et al. - 2021 - Environmental considerations for structural design.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128123","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Ecodesign; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable development; Plates (structural components); Carbon footprint; Land use; 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysed results show that the annual energy consumptions for this type of buildings vary significantly, and it is based on the value of the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of the envelopes. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the U-value for underground office buildings located in various climatic zones in China. With respect to the roof, an improvement in its thermal performance is significantly beneficial to the building in terms of annual energy demand.

The objective is to minimize the Life-Cycle Cost that comprises initial costs of the structure, the control system and costs related to repair, maintenance and downtime over the buildings lifetime. The integrated optimization of structural sections and mass ratio of the TMDs is carried out, leading to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that, differently from the traditional optimal design approach, it allows to perform the unified design of both the structure and the control system in a Life Cycle Cost Analysis framework. The procedure quantifies wind-induced losses, related to structural and nonstructural damage, considering the stochastic nature of the loads (wind velocity and direction), the specificity of the structural modeling (e.g., non-shear-type vibration modes and torsional effects) and the presence of the TMDs. Both serviceability and ultimate limit states related to the structure and the TMDs damage are adopted for the computation of repair costs.

Alternative adaptive insulation configurations and control strategies for opaque wall applications are evaluated, for an office room in a temperate climate of Shanghai, in order to optimise two design objectives: total primary energy saving and thermal comfort. It is found that adaptive insulation, when properly designed and controlled, has significant potential to improve both design objectives simultaneously. For the case study considered in this paper, yearly energy savings and thermal comfort improvements of up to 50% could be achieved by adaptive insulation compared to an equivalent astatic insulation alternative.

To achieve building energy efficient design optimization, algorithms are vital to generate new designs and thus drive the design optimization process. Therefore, the performance of algorithms is crucial to achieving effective energy efficient design techniques. This study evaluates algorithms used for building energy efficient design optimization. A set of performance indices, namely, stability, robustness, validity, speed, coverage, and locality, is proposed to evaluate the overall performance of algorithms. A benchmark building and a design optimization problem are also developed. HookeJeeves algorithm, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm II, and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are evaluated by using the proposed performance indices and benchmark design problem. Results indicate that no algorithm performs best in all six areas.

The growing importance of resource-efficiency and the reduction of the environmental impacts are being widely discussed and investigated. Therefore, the European Union (EU) countries have implemented energy efficiency regulations in all sectors, including the building sector, which is accountable for 40 % of energy consumption and 36 % of CO2 emissions within the EU. In modern facade constructions, the use of large-scaled glass elements is inevitable, which has led to the investigation of potential optimization of structural performance, energy efficiency and ecological characteristics of the structural building components. The Department of Structural Design and Timber Engineering (ITI) at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) developed several timber-based composite systems, combining timber and wood concrete on the one hand, as well as timber and structural glass components on the other hand. Through various combination of the individual composite systems, certain advantages as well as the synergies resulting from the different combinations could be shown. Different types of combined timber, wood concrete and glass composite structures for facades are developed, assessed and compared to conventional facade structures. The comparison is carried out regarding the materialization on component level, as well as the overall construction level, whereby a scale-independent assessment of the examined construction types could be reached. This assessment shall further be enabled by a broad-spectrum computation, ranging from static and dynamic thermal simulations for annual heating and overheating periods up to various thereof resulting ecological impact calculations. In terms of ecological building design, the conceptual implementation of the building envelope plays an important role in the thermal comfort of the inner rooms, as well as the glare and reflection by the use of daylight. One advantage of large-scale glass facades is the possibility to implement a high portion of solar entries into the total energy concept. The extremely versatile application possibilities allow different sectors of power generation, such as photovoltaic cells in the facade, thermal collectors for heat generation or algae panels, which generate biogas by photosynthesis process. The gained energy can further operate heating and cooling systems but also hot water supply. 2021 Ernst & Sohn GmbH & Co. KG. Published 2021 by Ernst & Sohn GmbH & Co.

Large commercial building envelopes can be utilized due to their great potential of reducing building energy consumption and increasing PV integration impact, especially in climate zones with rich solar resources. Most current studies have been focused on predicting electricity generation of BIPV systems with existing envelope geometries, while few studies have discussed the generation of proper envelope shapes for PV integration due to the challenge of integrating architecture and engineering. This paper introduces a novel optimization method for BIPV shape development based on the shape grammar theory. The method reforms given building shapes/envelopes to produce a set of better BIPV shape alternatives, as well as determines the best placement and matching BIPV systems for the optimized envelopes. The main set of criteria considered during the generation and optimization process include PV power generation, PV economic impact and building energy consumption. Architectural preferences are included in generating preferred design alternatives, such as view consideration and shape direction.

Wind-induced airflow plays a significant role in improving occupants' comfort in a building. This paper explores the extent to which simulation and evaluation of natural airflow can potentially be a contributing parameter in the conception of performance-aware designs. The authors employed Fast Fluid Dynamics simulation to study the natural ventilation performance of a pavilion and a genetic algorithm to optimize the shape of the pavilion's facades' openings. A performance analysis was conducted whereby an array of automated feedback loops carried out by a genetic algorithm produce a number of acceptable solutions. Hence the facade openings of these solutions are considered to be adequate to provide natural ventilation in the indoor environment. The study demonstrates the ability of the optimization model to yield design instances that fulfill a number of environmental criteria related to airflow and human comfort. In this light, the authors suggest that the aforementioned method can be used as an experimentation platform to influence and guide the designer during the initial stages of the design process towards a more performance-driven solution.  2014 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.","2014","2024-02-20 10:23:49","2024-02-20 10:23:49","","978-990","","8","90","","Simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0037549714537133","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Facades; Parameter estimation; Ventilation; Fluid dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventionally, the frequency constraint for the structural optimal design of a tall building is formulated through the strain energy method, and with the objective functions and constraint functions being established, the structural optimization problem is mathematically modeled, and the corresponding solution is solved using the optimal criteria (OC) method. This procedure has two disadvantages. First, the strain energy usually does not consider the gradient of the structural internal forces to the design variables, and so the computed sensitivity of the frequency constraint is inaccurate. Second, in the OC method, the Lagrangian multipliers are computed by solving a set of linear equations using the GaussSeidel method, which may lead to inaccurate results. To overcome these disadvantages, a new method is proposed by using an eigenvalue approach for computing the sensitivity of the frequency constraint and a quadratic programming approach for computing the Lagrangian multipliers. It is shown that the proposed new method can perform accurate wind-resistant structural optimal design for tall buildings and make the iterations of the optimal design converge faster and more stable. 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:49","2024-03-05 10:53:19","","","","18","27","","Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\9798R9SL\Fu et al. - 2018 - A new method for frequency constrained structural .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tal.1549","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind stress; Finite element method; Aerodynamic loads; Constrained optimization; Structural optimization; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Strain energy; Lagrange multipliers; Quadratic programming; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the fact that previous optimization designs usually ignore the external wind, the impacts of external wind on the optimum designing parameters are then investigated. It is confirmed that external wind could affect its optimum designing parameters, which are different from those previously obtained value in the literature without considering the external wind. For the analysed wall solar chimney, it was known that previously obtained optimal cavity depth of 0.20.3 m is no longer applicable under the external wind, and the optimal value rises to 0.40.5 m, while the same applies to inlet height/area. Solar chimney performance is enhanced under the external wind, which is not only because of the incoming wind flow from the room opening but also the reduced air resistance. It was observed that increased solar intensity shows limited influences on the overall airflow characteristics. Solar chimney performance also presented a generally enhanced trend under a low external wind speed, but a strong wind could dominate its performance with limited fluctuation even though the wind angle is higher as 45. It was known that the airflow rates through the solar chimney are largely hampered with a small cavity depth (i.e., smaller than 0.2 m) and inlet height under the external wind. And the airflow profiles are less affected when both of cavity depth and inlet height are bigger than 0.2 m. The obtained research outcomes could provide a technical guide on the optimization design of solar chimney in buildings.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:50","2024-02-20 10:23:50","","","","","42","","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2020.100842","Architectural design; Structural design; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Wind; Ventilation; Passive solar; Solar chimneys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an approach to design architectured ceramics using machine learning (ML), trained by finite element analysis data and together with a self-learning algorithm, to discover high-performance architectured ceramics in thermomechanical environments. First, topologically interlocked panels are parametrically generated. Then, a limited number of designed architectured ceramics subjected to a thermal load is studied. Finally, the multilinear perceptron is employed to train the ML model in order to predict the thermomechanical performance of architectured panels with varied interlocking angles and number of blocks. The developed feed-forward artificial neural network framework can boost the architectured ceramic design efficiency and open up new avenues for controllability of the functionality for various high-temperature applications. This study demonstrates that the architectured ceramic panels with the ML-assisted engineered patterns show improvement up to 30% in frictional energy dissipation and 7% in the sliding distance of the tiles and 80% reduction in the strain energy, leading to a higher safety factor and the structural failure delay compared to the plain ceramics.  2021 The Authors","2021","2024-02-20 10:23:50","2024-02-20 10:23:50","","","","","210","","Materials and Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\XBZJUDCI\Fatehi et al. - 2021 - Accelerated design of architectured ceramics with .pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2021.110056","Structural design; Finite element method; Energy efficiency; Network architecture; Topology; Safety factor; Energy dissipation; Strain energy; Learning algorithms; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; High temperature applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It creates opportunities for novel shapes that would not have been technologically feasible in the past. The key to this revolution resides in the link between material development and computational-based optimization design tools to produce optimized structures. Topology optimization is an intelligent approach to seek the best design in many fields of computational mechanics. By analysing the information inside the determined domain, it changes the topology of such domain into a new design to satisfy the given criterion. In most of the work, ideal materials are assumed to implement the topology optimization problems. Therefore, the optimal designs are still considered as reference or theoretical solutions while the practical problems need more than that. The multi-material topology optimization (MMTOP) is established to evaluate the behaviour of many materials in a problem and give an applicable solution for design. In this study, we present a polytree-based adaptive methodology for multi-material topology optimization (MMTOP). Polytree data structure is introduced as a general recursive multi-level mesh that is automatically refined in processing based on error analysis. A new definition of filter radius is also proposed to improve the efficiency of filters and optimized results. The combination of polytree meshes and adaptive filters not only clarifies the interfaces between material phases (including void phase), but also decreases the computing time of the overall process in comparison to using the regular fine meshes. Several benchmark and practical problems are considered to show distinct features of the proposed method. 3D printed prototypes are presented to demonstrate the fabrication feasibility of this method.  2018","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:51","2024-03-21 10:26:03","","79-90","","","99","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\3YH55X6E\Nguyen et al. - 2019 - Multi-material topology optimization for additive .pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.005","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Finite element method; Structural optimization; Topology; Additives; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Computational mechanics; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 7_Entire building; 5_Others (Not specified); 3_Stiffness (Compliance); 2_Others (plastic)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the proposed framework is based on first reformulating the bi-objective stochastic optimization problem into a suite of single-objective optimization problems through the -constraint approach. Secondly, a new optimization sub-problem is introduced for efficiently solving the single-objective problems, whose formulation is based on combining the auxiliary variable vector approach with a new kriging-enhanced approximation scheme. Because the sub-problem can be fully calibrated and subsequently solved from the results of a single performance assessment carried out in a fixed point of the design space, efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional problems is achieved. Through solving a sequence of sub-problems, solutions to the -constraint problems are obtained leading to the identification of the Pareto-optimal solutions of the original bi-objective optimization problem. To illustrate the applicability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework, an example of application to a large-scale structure is presented, where structural material volume and a system-level loss measure defined in terms of expectation and standard deviation of the total repair cost are simultaneously minimized.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:51","2024-03-25 10:55:00","","40-52","","","190","","Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\85EJPMZA\Suksuwan and Spence - 2019 - Performance-based bi-objective design optimization.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2019.03.028","Architectural design; Structural design; Stochastic systems; Efficiency; Pareto principle; Scalability; Monte Carlo methods; Intelligent systems; Kriging; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From this economic point of view, the optimum occurs when the global cost over the lifecycle of a building is minimized, and the cost-optimal energy performance level is that related to the minimum global cost. To determine this cost-optimal level by evaluating a great number of design alternatives, it is necessary to exploit automated optimization search procedures. The work presented here concerns the application of cost-optimal methodology, as defined by European regulation, to a low-consumption single-family house in France. The calculation is performed through an iterative input-output process in a computing environment that combines TRNSYS, transient system simulation tool, with GenOpt, generic optimization program. The methodology that was adopted allowed around ten thousand building configurations to be simulated in a reasonable computational time. The paper focuses on how the energy system affects the technical and economic optimal design solutions of the building in two different French climate conditions.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2024-02-20 10:23:52","2024-02-20 10:23:52","","109-127","","","70","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2016.06.007","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Iterative methods; Energy efficiency; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Zero energy buildings; Cost functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the reinforced masonry shear walls must be capable of resisting both vertical forces from gravity loads and lateral forces from seismic and wind loads. Typically, because the walls are subjected to high axial loads, ensuring the ductile response becomes challenging. A possible solution at the component level would be the utilization of walls with confined ends (i.e., walls with boundary elements) to reduce the compression zone and increase the compression strain. Another solution, which is at the system level, is the introduction of a hybrid structural system composed of two types of walls: (1) ductile walls with or without boundary elements to resist the lateral forces and part of vertical forces, and (2) gravity walls that resist only axial loads. This paper proposes a combination of both solutions (i.e., at component and system levels). Additionally, it utilizes a series of linear and nonlinear static and dynamic analyses to evaluate and quantify the effect of cross-section configuration and ductile shear wall area to total floor area (i.e., ductile shear wall ratio) on the seismic response of masonry buildings. The numerical analyses are performed by a macro model detailed to simulate the nonlinear response. The primary objective is to recommend a range of ductile shear wall ratios that optimize the design and overall performance. The study targets mid-rise and high-rise masonry buildings located in regions with moderate seismic hazard. The findings emphasize that utilizing the ductile walls with boundary elements in the proposed hybrid structural system resulted in major favorable enhancements in the structural response and optimization of the design. In addition, the results demonstrate the possibility of vertically reducing and terminating the specially detailed boundary elements, thus promoting ductile reinforced concrete masonry shear wall buildings as a competitive building system.  2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:52","2024-02-20 10:23:52","","","","4","146","","Journal of Structural Engineering (United States)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\JK6G8DD3\Aly and Galal - 2020 - Effect of Ductile Shear Wall Ratio and Cross-Secti.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002542","Architectural design; Structural design; Reinforced concrete; Shear walls; Seismic response; Shear flow; Boundary element method; Ductility; Axial loads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we separated out the beneficial and the harmful solar radiations from the radiation sky dome model, based on the air temperature data. Then, a new customized radiation sky dome model was created, according to the difference value between the beneficial and harmful solar radiations over a year. Furthermore, the neighboring buildings with various volume and number combinations were assigned to surround the study building, to explore the shading performance on the study building cast by the surrounding building(s).

Accordingly, the field has benefited extensively from research efforts in the past decade. However, the methods and terminology involved in modelling occupants in buildings remains fragmented across a large number of studies. This fragmentation represents a major obstacle to those who intend to join in this research endeavor as well as for the convergence and standardization of methods. To address this issue, this paper investigates occupant modelling methods for the key domains of electric lighting, blinds, operable windows, thermostats, plug loads, and occupancy. In the reviewed literature, five broad categories of occupant model formalisms were identified: schedules, Bernoulli models, discrete-time Markov models, discrete-event Markov models, and survival models. Illustrative examples were provided from two independent datasets to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of these model forms. It was shown that Markov models are suitable to represent occupants' adaptive behaviors, while survival models are suitable to represent occupancy, non-adaptive behaviors, and infrequently executed adaptive behaviors, such as the blinds opening behavior. Practical application : The engineering application of the occupant modelling formalisms that are critically reviewed in this paper is that these models are highly beneficial for incorporating occupants' presence and behaviors into building design and control. Building design can be improved significantly regarding energy use and occupant comfort when the most suitable occupant models are implemented in simulation-aided building design process. Ultimately, like for any modelling domain, the most suitable model is dependent on the modelling objective (e.g. optimizing passive design, equipment sizing), building type and size, occupant-related domain (e.g. occupancy, window-opening behavior), and climate zones. Furthermore, there is great potential in improving occupant comfort and energy savings of existing buildings when occupants' presence and interactions with buildings' systems and components are predicted accurately using occupant models.

Improper indoor temperature not only decreases the level of occupant thermal satisfaction, but also has serious health related consequences. Despite the importance of occupant thermal satisfaction that has been vastly emphasized, studies incorporating occupants' satisfaction during the design process are very limited. Therefore, this study aims to develop a multi-objective design optimization model to minimize life cycle cost and life cycle emission, and maximize occupant satisfaction level in a typical commercial building. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, a Harmony Search based algorithm is developed and employed. Moreover, to identify the level of design thermal satisfaction, a novel utility-theory based thermal comfort index is defined and calculated. A small office building is selected as a case study to analyze four different designs which are identified as optimum solutions. To determine the optimum designs, the satisfaction level of all the design combinations having cost and emissions similar to previously distinguished optimum solutions are compared and best designs are identified.  2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:53","2024-02-20 10:23:53","","606-615","","","121","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.01.049","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Costs; Office buildings; Multiobjective optimization; Environmental impact; Thermal comfort","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a review of bionic technologies for building functions, structures, and materials, the present study analyzes applications and typical cases of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture. For example, utilizing the wisdom of nature in buildings, architectural innovations using bionic functions have been created based on the favorable natural ventilation system found in termite mounds. Moreover, passive construction technology using solar energy resources can not only improve the indoor thermal environment but also achieve low energy consumption for buildings. Drawing inspiration from mechanical properties, structural relationships, and the material performance of natural objects, and applying this to a building's structure or shape design, large span structures, such as suspension cable and thin shell structure, which imitate cobwebs and eggshell respectively, have been designed to improve the efficiency of building resources. Using polar bear fur, lotus leaves, and other natural animals and plants as bionic building materials, self-compensation, regulation, and maintenance mechanisms have been achieved on building surfaces, allowing the buildings to actively adapt to their environment, thus reflecting the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment, and achieving the green development of buildings with high efficiency and low energy consumption. In addition, based on ecological principles and climate-adaptive design rules, the present study proposes an overall design concept for bionic green architecture and further notes that, in future research, it will be necessary to implement the following: strengthen the integration and optimization of diverse green building technologies; manage the energy efficiency of bionic buildings throughout their life cycles; develop bionic technologies for building functions based on the principle of regional suitability; promote innovative bionic technologies for building structures based on the principle of green ecological coexistence; and strengthen the research, development, and application of bionic building materials that regulate, repair, clean, and protect themselves. In short, the development of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture should follow and respect natural laws. It is necessary to study the mechanisms used in biological systems, which, combined with modern building technologies, should be employed to support building innovation and to realize the rapid development of building energy efficiency and green buildings.  2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:53","2024-02-20 10:23:53","","771-787","","","74","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.004","Architectural design; Structural design; Building materials; Energy efficiency; Ecodesign; Sustainable development; Energy utilization; Ventilation; Ecology; Solar energy; Mammals; Bionics; Plants (botany)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a two-step multi-objective optimization approach to size both thermal and electrical energy systems in regard of thermo-economic performance indicators to suit consumer and grid operator interests. Several utilities such as storage, conversion systems, and RERs are hence modeled and formulated through mixed-integer linear programming. Simultaneously, the algorithm defines the optimal operation strategy, based on a model predictive control structure, for each deterministic unit embedded within the energy management system of the building to meet the different comfort and service requirements. The developed design framework is successfully applied on several energy systems configuration of typical Swiss building types.

This has been driving research in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) toward rigorous multidisciplinary decision-making frameworks that generate and evaluate numerous design alternatives using multi-objective optimization in concert with simulation and analysis models of varying fidelity and computational expense. While such frameworks are well known and widely employed in the aerospace and systems engineering domains, efforts by design professionals and researchers in the AEC field are scattered at best. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of recent developments in optimization frameworks in the AEC field and subsequently highlight how such developments are largely compartmentalized into separate domains such as structural, energy, daylighting, and other performance factors. We further discuss the technical challenges involved in concurrent coupled multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the AEC field such as interoperability issues between Building Information Modeling (BIM) environments, analysis/simulation tools, and optimization frameworks. We conclude by outlining research needed for more unified modeling and simulation-based optimization frameworks to aid in complex and multidisciplinary building design processes. We also highlight the need for the identification and development of multi-fidelity simulation tools for use across multiple design phases. As such, this paper contributes a novel roadmap to leverage aerospace and systems engineering research in MDO into the field of AEC, along with a call for researchers in the MDO community to seek collaborations in AEC field.  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2023","2024-02-20 10:23:53","2024-02-20 10:23:53","","","","11","66","","Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-023-03673-y","Architectural design; Structural design; Decision making; Interoperability; Multiobjective optimization; Design aids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy consumption may be reduced at the design stage by selecting the proper building elements. This study develops a multi-objective analysis for a highly efficient slab-on-ground floor, whose design is optimized for a warm climate. Possible floor configurations have been obtained using the software tools modeFRONTIER, for the multi-objective analysis, and MATLAB, for the computational code. To proceed with the optimization of the different floor layers, a dataset has been developed for several materials in relation to a number of parameters: thermo-physical properties, eco-sustainability score according to the ITACA Protocol, costs, source, and structural features. Results highlight how a high surface mass is preferable when guaranteed by concrete in the innermost and outermost layers. Furthermore, insulating materials are better placed in the middle layers, with the insulating and synthetic materials adjacent to the ground and insulating and natural materials adjacent to the floor. Results emphasize the importance of thermal transmittance close to the Italian regulation limit (0.38 W/m2 K) in the climatic zone C, to allow an adequate exchange with the ground in summer, avoiding overheating. The outcomes show that the obtained slab-on-ground floor configurations favor the use of local, recyclable, sustainable, and eco-friendly materials, which is in line with energy policies and sustainability protocols. The paper supports the decision making process that takes many variables into account at the building design stage.  2018 by the authors.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:53","2024-02-20 10:23:53","","","","11","11","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\GGDG7MQU\Baglivo et al. - 2018 - Multi-objective analysis for the optimization of a.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en11112988","Architectural design; Floors; Structural design; Decision making; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Insulation; MATLAB; Computer aided software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the research is to evaluate the daylight availability in an industrial building under a fixed level of orientation and design. The research initiates by field measurements on the building by an illuminance meter. For the comparative effectiveness, a simulation method is incorporated in the research for a comparative and optimized validation of the daylighting factor. Velux Daylight Visualizer is utilized in this research to simulate the daylighting by modelling the building surface 3 dimensionally with optimal window and glazing material and rendered it to actual interior surface to measure the daylighting at hourly working time zones. Sequentially, the energy utilization of the building is also measured using Velux EIC Visualizer, where the temperature comfort and the total energy utilized for lighting and ventilation is also measured.

This study proposed a simulation-based multi-objective optimization method to minimize both life cycle cost and CO2 emissions of buildings. We built an energy simulation model with hybrid ventilation and light-dimming control in EnergyPlus based on an operational passive residential building in a severe cold climate. Next, this investigation selected insulation thickness, window type, window-to-wall ratio, overhang depth and building orientation as design variables.

Probability method can represent characteristics of uncertain cooling loads well, but a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations should be carried out. The optimal cooling source design can be formulated as a mixed-integer-linear-programming model (MILP), which can be solved efficiently to obtain the global optimality using a state-of-the-art MILP solver. However, if all the MC simulations are used in the optimization problem, the size of MILP model would lead to computational issues or even be unsolvable. This study, therefore, proposes a robust optimization design model for sizing the cooling source when there is cooling load uncertainty. A method named in this paper cooling load bin is proposed and implemented by converting time series cooling loads obtained by MC simulations to those in the frequency domain. Therefore, the cooling load frequency and mean value in each cooling interval are obtained and used in the optimal design model, which can be solved efficiently by the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The robust model is applied to the optimal design of a cooling source to minimize the cost. A case study on the cooling source of a hospital in Tianjin is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust model. Furthermore, the accuracy of the solution and the computational efficiency used to evaluate the proposed robust model are systematically investigated and compared with the deterministic model.  2019","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:54","2024-02-20 10:23:54","","390-403","","","241","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.062","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Computational efficiency; Frequency domain analysis; Integer programming; Air conditioning; Monte Carlo methods; Cooling; Intelligent systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not comprehensive to blindly pursue the lowest energy consumption when optimizing design schemes. In this case, it is of great research significance to build a fast and efficient optimal model to balance different objectives. A bi-objective integer programming optimization model is proposed to minimize energy consumption and investment costs based on the analysis of the architectural and social environments in which public buildings are located. The key parameters of the building envelope are thus identified on this basis, and a variety of optimal design schemes that consider investment cost and energy consumption are designed. The model is then implemented in AMPL equipped with the CPLEX solver and solved by the improved epsilon-constraint method. Finally, a real-world case study in Qingdao is taken to validate the developed model, and the resultant Pareto frontier is evaluated to prove the trade-off between objectives. The results show that the proposed model effectively reduces building energy consumption and investment costs in the design stage. The comparison with other algorithms proves that the proposed method has good search and optimization capabilities.

A systematic approach to synthesize such hinges is currently lacking. In this paper, a new building block-based spatial topology synthesis method is presented for optimizing large-stroke flexure hinges. This method consists of a layout variation strategy based on a building block approach combined with a shape optimization to obtain the optimal design tuned for a specific application. A derivative-free shape optimization method is adapted to include multiple system boundaries and constraints to optimize high complexity flexure mechanisms in a broad solution space. To obtain the optimal layout, three predefined three-dimensional (3D) ""building blocks"" are proposed, which are consecutively combined to find the best layout with respect to specific design criteria. More specifically, this new method is used to optimize a flexure hinge aimed at maximizing the frequency of the first unwanted vibration mode. The optimized topology shows an increase in frequency of a factor ten with respect to the customary three flexure cross hinge (TFCH), which represents a huge improvement in performance. The numerically predicted natural frequencies and mode shapes have been verified experimentally.  2017 by ASME.","2017","2024-02-20 10:23:54","2024-02-20 10:23:54","","","","4","9","","Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\QRKM528U\Naves et al. - 2017 - Building block-based spatial topology synthesis me.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4036223","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Topology; Mechanisms; Hinges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis is focused on residential buildings since these buildings consume over 48% of the total electricity used in Bahrain. The optimization analysis has the benefit to assess both at the individual building and the national building stock levels, the potential of the application of currently proven measures and technologies to improve the energy efficiency of the building sector in Bahrain. A sequential search technique is utilized to optimize the design of residential buildings in Manama in order to minimize life cycle energy costs using a wide range of energy efficiency measures. In the analysis, design features of air-conditioned single-family homes are considered including orientation, window location and size, glazing type, wall and roof insulation levels, lighting fixtures, appliances, and efficiencies of heating and cooling systems. Based on the optimization results, the potential energy use savings obtained for the optimal designs as well as the size of the photovoltaic panels required for net-zero energy residential building designs are estimated for Bahrain. Then, the economic and environmental impacts of developing and enforcing a more stringent building energy efficiency code are evaluated for Bahrain. The analysis indicate that the development and enforcement of a more stringent building energy efficiency code improve the energy productivity of buildings as well as the country with reduction of over 320 GWh in annual electricity consumption and 87 MW in peak demand. The analysis extended to the existing residential building stock indicates that Bahrain has the potential to cost-effectively decrease its energy consumption in the building sector by 62% with a reduction of 55% in its electrical peak demand in the future compared to the business as usual scenario.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:55","2024-02-20 10:23:55","","40-50","","","18","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2018.02.018","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Air conditioning; Housing; Cooling systems; Potential energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indices show climate alterations have occurred in Khartoum, Sudan, resulting in uncomfortable and challenging-to-manage indoor conditions. In this study, Khartoum's climate data from 1981 to 2015 was analyzed and compared to identify trends in temperature, precipitation, and sand-dust storm intensification. Metronome Company created Khartoum's hourly weather file from averages of basic climate parameters available for 1996 to 2015 and Meteonorm 7.2.1 calculated an hourly climate file for Khartoum in 2070. These figures were then related to design characteristics and lifecycles of local buildings. To counter 2070 climate conditions, resilient design strategies were evaluated to optimize thermal comfort for building users and minimize energy usage today and in the future. A comparison of design strategies from the year 2015 to those for 2070 discovered that strategies must shift to more active-cooling by the year 2070 when natural ventilation and active heating will no longer be beneficial design strategies during all seasons. While two-stage evaporative cooling is the most strategic for all of Khartoum's seasons, more resilient passive-design strategies should be adapted for use with Khartoum's underutilized renewable resources to reduce future active-cooling demand and optimize thermal comfort.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:55","2024-02-20 10:23:55","","","","","47","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101429","Architectural design; Structural design; Ventilation; Thermal comfort; Climate change; Evaporative cooling systems; Storms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous works demonstrated that the TMDI leads to efficient broadband vibration control for a range of different structures under different dynamic excitations. This paper proposes a novel optimal TMDI design formulation to address occupants comfort in wind-excited slender tall buildings susceptible to vortex shedding (VS) effects and to explore optimal TMDI's potential for transforming part of the wind-induced kinetic energy to usable electricity in tall buildings. Attention is focused on investigating benefits of TMDIs with different inertial properties (i.e., secondary mass/weight and inertance) configured in different topologies defined by the number of floors spanned by the inerter device to connect the secondary mass to the building structure. Optimally designed TMDIs for a wide range of inertial properties and three different topologies are obtained through numerical solution of the underlying optimization problem for a benchmark 305.9 m tall building with more than 6 height-to-width ratio subjected to experimentally calibrated spatially-correlated across-wind force field accounting for VS effects. Fixed performance design graphs on the TMDI inertial (mass-inertance) plane are furnished demonstrating that any fixed structural performance level in terms of occupants comfort (i.e., peak top floor acceleration) can be achieved through lightweight TMDIs as long as sufficient inertance is provided. Further, TMDI robustness to host structure properties and to reference wind velocity is shown to increase by increasing inertance or by spanning more floors in connecting the secondary mass with the host structure by the inerter. Lastly, it is found that increased available energy for harvesting in wind excited tall buildings is achieved by incorporating electromagnetic motors in TMDIs with varying damping property, while concurrent reduced floor acceleration and increased available energy for harvesting is accomplished by TMDI topologies with inerters spanning more floors.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:55","2024-03-21 15:43:40","","","","","204","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\BU6PTKYN\Petrini et al. - 2020 - Optimal tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI) design in.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109904","Architectural design; Floors; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Topology; Acoustic devices; Structural properties; Energy harvesting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Vortex flow; Vortex shedding; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Building_Component (TMD); 3_Others (damper parameter); 1_Others (damper, interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this case study, the project site is located in a coastal city in China, featuring complicated subsurface soil conditions with abundant large boulders. The project was put on hold for a decade because in the complicated soil conditions the piles could not be installed to the required depths. The project resumed with introduction of deformation adjustors which helped to shift the applied loads from piles to subsoil below the raft and thus considerably reduced the pile lengths.

Based on the long-term monitoring, subsoil below the raft was able to bear 83% of total applied loads, whereas the piles carried 17% of the loads.

However, the topology optimization results are not usually known for direct realization in practice, and the engineer and architect should be able to choose the best solution among numerous choices in close cooperation.

The bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method was employed, considering the main optimization parameter, loading scenarios, and constraints. In order to show the effectiveness of the suggested topology optimization framework for minimizing compliance (maximizing stiffness) and minimum consumption of materials in the design of lateral bracing systems, 2D and 3D systems have been discussed.

The quantity of absorbed solar energy depends on building's shape, the orientation of its exposed surfaces to radiation, the shading equipment and the absorption coefficient of the concerned surfaces. This study introduces a novel approach that enables the optimal design of a building shell based on the optimization of its solar exposure. Non-linear programming (simplex algorithm) was used for determining the optimal building geometry. The objective function considered was related to the optimization of building's solar heat gain. The optimization constraints represented a list of morphological and seasonal restrictions expressed as non-linear functions. The cumulative seasonal and annual solar exposure of the considered building was resolved by employing the methodology described in the EN ISO 13790:2008 standard.

This, most of the times, results in structures becoming bluff bodies characterized by high wind-structure interaction induced loads. These effects can be significantly reduced through novel aerodynamic mitigation techniques and optimal aerodynamic shape design procedures. This paper reviews the past/recent work on various aerodynamic mitigation techniques developed for reducing wind loads on buildings by modifying their shapes and/or adding simple architectural elements. Aerodynamic mitigation techniques applicable to low-rise and high-rise buildings have been reviewed. In addition, aerodynamic shape optimization techniques for reducing wind loads on tall buildings are presented and the suitability and challenges of using Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) for this application are discussed. An overview of the optimization techniques namely gradient based methods and non-gradient based methods are presented. It is expected that this research can ignite an interest in using aerodynamic shapes and consideration of the structures' shape, in terms of wind performance, early in the design process. This paper also serves as a source for various techniques that can be used for reducing wind loads on buildings.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The error estimation of the Kriging model is used for an adaptive sequential design to improve the Kriging model accuracy.  genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is considered efficient to find the global optimal solutions. We also propose a new algorithm to reduce the calculation time even further. The new individuals of the adaptive sequential design are filtered with satisfaction functions. It means that only the useful part of the Pareto front will be determined. Finally, we use network visualization for decision-making.

For optimal design of this system, it is required that the uncertainties which may exist in the system be taken into account. This consideration is performed through the robust design optimization (RDO) procedure. To evaluate the optimal values of the design parameters, three non-commensurable objective functions namely: normalized values of the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration of each story level are considered to minimize simultaneously. For this purpose, a fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) approach is used to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The torsional effects due to irregularities of the building and/or unsymmetrical placements of the dampers are taken into account through the 3-D modeling of the building. Finally, the comparison of the results shows that the probabilistic robust STMD system is capable of providing a reduction of about 52%, 42.5%, and 37.24% on the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the building top story, respectively.  2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:23:57","2024-02-20 10:23:57","","347-369","","2","11","","Earthquake and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Techno-Press","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.12989/eas.2016.11.2.347","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We depart from the classical unit operation-based representation of process units, flowsheets and superstructures and propose a new representation using fundamental building blocks. These building blocks can be associated with different process phenomena, tasks and unit operations. An assembly of blocks of the same type obtains a classical unit, while an assembly of blocks with different types results in an intensified unit. This allows to systematically identify and incorporate many intensification pathways using a general block-based superstructure. We design an intensified process by optimizing a performance metric for given raw materials and product specifications, material properties and bounds on flow rates. The overall problem is formulated using a single mixed-integer nonlinear optimization (MINLP) model that can be solved using commercial solvers.

The structure is modeled as a shear frame and considered as linear. The upper and lower limit values of the dampers are defined as passive constraints, while the damping coefficients of the dampers placed in each storey are considered as the design variables. The use of these technological tools in construction has caused a serious cost increase. It is therefore important to use minimum of these elements. For this reason, the sum of the damping coefficients of the dampers is regarded as the objective function and is minimized as an indication of the capacities of the dampers placed in the building stories and thus their costs. It is well known that the addition of dampers to the structure increases the damping ratio of the structure. A new active constraint is included in the optimization problem as the target damping ratio. The equation required for the calculation of the value of the target damping ratio corresponding to any mode is also derived. The simple optimization problem is solved using three different optimization algorithms: Simulated Annealing, Nelder Mead and Differential Evolution algorithms. Optimum designs are found to minimize the cost function and provide all constraints. In the shown numerical example, the effect of the variation of the building period and the changes of the target damping ratio on the optimization is investigated. Furthermore, earthquake behavior of the structure corresponding to these optimum designs is investigated using El Centro Earthquake (NS) record and examined in terms of period and additional damping ratios of the maximum displacements to the floors. In addition, the proposed method finds the optimum damper distribution considering the first two modes. The proposed optimum damper design method is very simple and it is a method which reaches the optimum designs in different mode behaviors. As a result, it has been shown in the numerical examples that the optimum damper design can be changed according to the variations of the designer's constraints.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:23:57","2024-03-12 15:41:10","","17-28","","","439","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Academic Press","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\T3JF4AMP\Aydin et al. - 2019 - Analysis of efficiency of passive dampers in multi.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2018.09.031","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Damping; Evolutionary algorithms; Earthquakes; Office buildings; Efficiency; Simulated annealing; Cost functions; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Cost; 1_Others (damper); 2_Others (damper); 7_Building_Component (damper)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-story buildings are part of a relatively specialized field of design and construction projects. They deal not only with a building's design and creation but also with its ongoing operation and maintenance. Because a large portion of the money and time expended by both the public and private sectors is used for construction, especially multi-story buildings, it is essential for owners and builders to think about how to optimize the balance between cost and function as they make major decisions about multi-story buildings. The concept of value engineering has evolved significantly and has been expanded over the years; today, numerous standards and related manuals exist. Various engineering databases, international journals, and conference proceedings were searched. International journals were searched for relevant research papers.

A generic building model is constructed with a proposed MM (mixed-mode) ventilation control strategy to fulfill the thermal comfort requirement in the local green building guidance. The numerical modeling results are used to conduct both local and global sensitivity analyses to determine the relative importance of major passive design parameters, which comprehensively cover design aspects of the building layout, envelop thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration & air-tightness. The calculated global and local sensitivity indices on the cooling energy prove that the window solar heat gain coefficient, window to ground ratio, external obstruction and overhang projection fraction are the four most influential passive design factors. Similar results are also obtained when the lighting energy is specified as the output of the sensitivity analysis. The optimized building model derived from the sensitivity analysis is anticipated to achieve an energy saving of 41.6% compared to the baseline model as stipulated by the local building regulation. It is believed that sensitivity analysis is useful for identifying crucial design parameters to facilitate further optimization of the building performance in early architectural design stages. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2024-02-20 10:23:58","2024-02-20 10:23:58","","1804-1818","","","93","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.061","Architectural design; Structural design; Sensitivity analysis; Energy conservation; Thermal comfort; Apartment houses; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The integrated design process is the modern way to realize ""performance architecture,"" that is, design with a view to field performance. Integrated design process permits merging of concepts from passive-house designs, solar engineering, and an integration of the building enclosure with mechanical services. In part 1 of this series, the emergence of many new multi-functional materials was discussed. Yet, current innovation is guided by lessons from history. Thermal mass in heavy masonry buildings allowed periodic heating. The authors postulate integration of a hydronic heating system with the walls and the use of smart temperature control of the heating system to modify and optimize the thermal mass contribution. To use the mass of a building, one must accept transient temperature conditions where the indoor temperature varies but is confined by comfort requirements for both summer and winter conditions. On the other side, resiliency requirements dictate that in the absence of electricity the air temperature does not fall below about 12C over a period of several hours. This requirement implies that summer cooling will likely be separated from the heating systems and that operation of a low-energy building is heavily dependent on the design of smart control systems. Analysis of control systems provided in this article for earth-to-air heat exchangers and cooling of houses with lightweight walls lead us to the requirements of separation between heating and ventilation and needs for different sources of fresh air. Finally, a new concept emerges.  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:58","2024-02-20 10:23:58","","397-417","","5","41","","Journal of Building Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1744259117735465","Architectural design; Structural design; Building materials; Control systems; Sustainable development; Integration; Walls (structural partitions); Air conditioning; Heating equipment; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Cooling systems; Functional materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these tools can help promote green building designs and operations, they do not provide a quantitative measure of the overall impact of a facility on the environment. This is due to the fact that most of the current green rating assessment tools utilise the point-based rating system. Such system has several limitations. First, it can only provide a relative measure of the greenness of a system. Secondly, the points awarded may not be consistent as it can vary from one assessor to another. Finally, the available rating tools do not provide a single indicator of the greenness of a system as each green element of a system is evaluated separately rather than as a whole. This paper presents a new tool for assessing the greenness of a facility that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. The use of the stock market composite index as a tool to assess the stock market performance has been extended to the domain of facility management that includes industrial and commercial buildings. The composite index has been utilised as the basis to develop a Green Index to assess and manage an organisation's level of greenness. The advantage of the composite index that could capture the movement of price within each stock and reflect it into a single composite index could be used in measuring and monitoring the impacts contributed by the individual green elements, on the environment. Results show that the formulation of the Green Index with weighting assignment using factor analysis would help organisations simultaneously optimise and improve their energy and water consumption, as well as waste generation. In addition, the Green Index graph provides facility managers with a graphical tool to visualise and gain insights on the performance trend of a facility.

This study aims to investigate the effect of building facade elements and energy-efficient building systems on reaching nZEB with two different design approaches (DAs). These approaches are investigated through the case of a selected office building's facade retrofit options in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort. In the first DA, different design variables of a double skin facade (DSF) are investigated and optimized in order to decrease the total amount of consumed energy, and the best parameters are used in the design of the south facade. In the second DA, the building retrofit aims to meet nZEB criteria by redesigning the south building facade via genetic algorithm optimization, while providing thermal comfort in all months and reducing the number of discomfort hours. The investigation is carried out via building energy simulation (BES) of a selected office building, validated by indoor and outdoor measurements. The results show that the parameters of the building facade can play a significant role in decreasing the energy consumption of the building, and both DAs decrease total energy consumption while utilizing currently feasible and common building technologies. Yet, in the second DA not only is the energy consumption lower but, it also significantly decreases discomfort hours.  2020 International Energy Initiative","2020","2024-02-20 10:23:58","2024-02-20 10:23:58","","167-181","","","58","","Energy for Sustainable Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2020.08.004","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Facades; Energy utilization; Retrofitting; Intelligent buildings; Thermal comfort; Zero energy buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill that gap, we have numerically investigated air-clad waveguides, tapers, and S-bends, with the aim to minimize insertion losses, whilst reducing the device sizes. We have first demonstrated waveguides with square and circular cross-sections that are mode-matched with single-mode optical fibers featuring insertion losses below -0.6 dB and -1.5 dB around 1550 nm for lengths of respectively 0.2 mm and 1 mm. We have also identified parabolic tapers that allow for adiabatic transition between a wide range of input and output waveguide sizes. These shapes allow, for example, tapering down from 15 m to 2 m diameter waveguides over a length as short as 43.2 m. We have fabricated a series of such components and confirmed their nearly lossless performance with insertion loss measurements. Finally, we have designed and optimized S-bends with Bezier curve shapes. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we have fabricated a 160 m long S-bend that offsets the waveguide axis by 50 m. The insertion loss of the resulting 400 m long component, which also included two parabolic tapers, was less than -1.7 dB. Apart from providing design rules and ready-to-use recipes for fabricating low-loss 3D-printed waveguide-based building blocks, we project that our work will spark the development of a series of efficient photonic devices that rely on these components and that can be exploited in diverse application fields.  2021 The Author(s).

A three-step selection process was applied to refine the search terms and to discard works investigating mechanical, structural, and seismic topics. Meta-analysis of the results highlighted that multi-objective optimization models are widely exploited for (i) enhancing buildings energy efficiency, (ii) improving thermal and (iii) visual comfort, minimizing (iv) life-cycle costs, and (v) emissions. Reviewed workflows demonstrated to be suitable for exploring different design alternatives for building envelope, systems layout, and occupancy patterns.

However, as the goal of sustainability has become a common one throughout Europe and beyond, it is now established that the energy performance of Passive Houses has to satisfy thermal comfort under diverse climatic conditions, in order to enable its adequate global applicability. This study presents the monitored performance of the first Passive House designed and constructed in Cyprus, a south-eastern Mediterranean European country with subtropical climatic conditions. This study aims to provide useful insights to improve the performance of Passive Houses in subtropical climates. The ""as built"" performance of the investigated building is compared to its asset design, revealing design gaps and possibilities for improvement. Different zones of the building were selected for investigation and the percentage of overheating in the examined zones was specified. The thermal performance of the examined building was also numerically investigated, by means of dynamic simulation in order to consider improvement options. The simulation model was validated for a cooling design day. The performance of a single zone was further investigated using CFD simulation for a specific summer day and the effect of potential measures for the improvement of its thermal performance was evaluated. An average reduction of 1.4C of the indoor air temperature was achieved by applying an optimized strategy for night ventilation, while the increase of the cooling capacity of the HVAC was found to significantly improve the thermal performance of the zone. The effect of external thermal coating application was also examined.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2024-02-20 10:23:59","2024-02-20 10:23:59","","14-31","","","133","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.09.060","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Sustainable development; Heating; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Houses; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A methodology is implemented to systematically derive the tilt and azimuth angles of each rooftop and to quantify solar direct, diffuse, and global horizontal irradiance for hundreds of buildings in a LiDAR tile scale, by using already established methodologies that are typically only applied to a single location or building rooftop. The methodology enables the formulation of typical meteorological data, measured or forecasted time series of irradiances over distributed assets. A new concept on the subject of distributed solar plant (DSP) design is also introduced, by using the building rooftop tilt and azimuth angles, to strategically optimize the use and adoption of solar incentives according to the grid age and its vulnerabilities to solar variability in the neighborhoods. The method presented here shows that on an hourly basis DSP design could provide a 5% and 9% of net load capacity support per hour in the afternoon and morning times, respectively. Our results show that standard building rooftop tilt angles in the south Texas region has significant impact on the total amount of the energy over the course of a day, though its impact on the shapes of the daily energy profile is relatively insignificant when compared to the azimuth angle. Building surfaces' azimuth angle is the most important factor to determine the shape of daily energy profile and its peak location within a day. The methodology developed in this study can be employed to study the potential solar energy in other regions and to match the design of distributed solar plants to the capacity needs on specified distribution grids.  2016 by the authors.","2016","2024-02-20 10:23:59","2024-02-20 10:23:59","","","","3","8","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8030247","Architectural design; Structural design; Mapping; Solar power generation; Meteorology; Optical radar; Solar energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An original generative workflow based on parametric design was developed in the Grasshopper environment to conduct energy analyses, such as solar radiation and daylighting, and environmental impact analysis, to evaluate the embodied and operational greenhouse gas emissions of the building. The workflow was generated to control parametrically several building features while varying the building shape, the dimensions of construction components, and the quantity of materials. The process leads to the generation of shapes with the least environmental impact. The workflow allows the modification of the initial shape of the Base Case by running iterative simulations through the Galapagos and Octopus evolutionary solvers. For each stage of the shape's optimization, through passive and active strategies, the embodied emissions and energy balances were estimated to evaluate how the building design varies in terms of energy and environmental impact, and to identify the implications for the design. This paper shows how design options with low levels of embodied emissions can be generated and optimized automatically, and also demonstrates how a parametric design approach provides the designer with suggestions of low-impact solutions, which can then be integrated and considered early in, and throughout, the design process in a holistic manner.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-02-20 10:23:59","2024-02-20 10:23:59","","106-123","","","167","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.025","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Parameter estimation; Environmental impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For NZEBs, annual energy balance between renewable energy generation and building energy consumption is an essential and fundamental requirement. Conventional RES (renewable energy system) design methods for NZEBs have not systematically considered uncertainties associated with building energy generation and consumption. As a result, either the annual energy balance cannot be achieved or the initial investment of RES is unnecessarily large. Meanwhile, the uncertainties also have significant impacts on NZEB power mismatch which can cause severe grid stress. In order to overcome the above challenges, this study proposes a multi-criterion RES design optimization method for NZEBs under uncertainties. Under the uncertainties, Monte Carlo simulations have been employed to estimate the annual energy balance and the grid stress caused by power mismatch. Three criteria, namely the annual energy balance reliability, the grid stress and the initial investment, are used to evaluate the overall RES design performance based on user-defined weighted factors. A case study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the size of RES under uncertainties.  2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:24:00","2024-02-20 10:24:00","","654-665","","","94","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.044","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy utilization; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Monte Carlo methods; Zero energy buildings; Renewable energy resources; Intelligent systems; Energy balance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early design decisions have a significant impact on the energy performance of buildings. The paper presents the multi-variable optimization of the selected design parameters in a single-family building in temperate climate conditions. The influence of four types of windows, their size, building orientation, insulation of external wall, roof and ground floor and infiltration on the life cycle costs (LCC) is analyzed. Optimal selection of the design parameters is carried out using genetic algorithms by coupling the building performance simulation program EnergyPlus with optimization environment. The simulations were conducted for seven optimization cases. The analysis is performed for two variants of a building with heating and cooling systems and with a heating system only. Depending on the analyzed case, the life cycle costs decreased from 7% to 34% LCC value of the reference building. In the case of temperate climate, the building optimization (in terms of heat demand only) substantially reduces the heating costs, yet the summer thermal comfort conditions deteriorate significantly.","2017","2024-02-20 10:24:00","2024-02-20 10:24:00","","","","10","10","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en10101570","Architectural design; Floors; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Costs; Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Heating equipment; Heating; Cooling systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, simulation-based decision support during the early stages of building design is in high demand. Building designs are multi-objective optimization processes in which unquantified values, such as the design preferences of architects or clients, are included as objective functions along with building performance. In this context, showing architects the response surface between window geometries and building performance is useful for their decision making. This study proposes a procedure for creating a response surface in a feasible manner. In the procedure, the number of dynamic daylighting simulations is reduced by creating a link between the daylight factor (DF) and daylight autonomy (DA). In addition, the procedure allows for the estimation of electric lighting energy savings with high resolution by integrating dynamic daylighting simulation tools into energy simulation tools. In the case studies, DAYSIM and EnergyPlus are used to create the response surfaces. The impact of COPs for the cooling and heating systems on the features of the response surface can be easily analyzed. Higher COP results in a narrower selectable design range in cases where the same percentage of acceptable ranges for building performance degradation is employed (from 30-100% to 60-100%). The method was validated with detailed simulation outputs. The error caused by the proposed procedure (below 1%) was negligible compared with the error caused by the selection of the daylight simulation algorithm (approximately 5%).  2015 Elsevier B.V.

They are commonly used for low-rise commercial, light industrial and agricultural buildings. In this paper, the effect of stressed-skin action on the optimum design of CFS portal frames is investigated by conducting a minimum cost design optimisation on a building of span of 6 m, height-to-eaves of 3 m and frame spacing of 3 m; the effect of different number of bays are considered. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that gables are rigid.The effect of stressed-skin action is larger for""square-shaped"" buildings (i.e. when the span and length are the same on plan) and decreases as more bays are added(i.e. as the building becomes more ""rectangular-shaped"" on plan). The results of the minimum cost optimisation indicate that if stressed-skin action is taken into account, the cost of the internal frame can be reduced by around half for ""square-shaped"" buildings. It should be noted that this is a minimum cost optimisation, which is not the same as a minimum weight optimisation. It is also shown that a safe design of internal frames could be obtained by ignoring wind loads (i.e. designing the frame only for gravity loads),but this is limited to buildings having a ""square-shape"".  2016, Korean Society of Steel Construction and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2016","2024-02-20 10:24:01","2024-03-19 10:56:44","","299-307","","2","16","","International Journal of Steel Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Society of Steel Construction","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\8AU9GSL4\Wrzesien et al. - 2016 - Effect of stressed-skin action on optimal design o.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13296-016-6004-2","Architectural design; Structural design; Costs; Studs (structural members); 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 5_Spatial (Warehouse)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a new methodology is advanced to incorporate the uncertainties associated with RE resources and load in sizing an HRES in the application of buildings with low to high renewable energy ratio (RER). Dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm, simulation module, and sampling average technique are used to approximate a Pareto front (PF) for an HRES design through a multi-objective optimization framework. The main aim of design is to simultaneously minimize total net present cost (NPC), maximize renewable energy ratio, and minimize fuel emission while satisfy a desirable level of loss of load probability (LLP). The existing randomness in wind speed, solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and energy load is considered using synthetically data generation and sampling average method. The performance of the model has been examined in a building located in Canada as the case study, in which RER of the building is increased by using renewable energy technologies. The generated PF by the stochastic approach is compared to a deterministic PF using well-known performance metrics.

However, conventional passive solar buildings are insufficient to create a relatively stable and comfortable indoor thermal environment. To further increase the indoor air temperature and reduce the heating energy consumption, a hybrid heat collecting facade (HHCF) is proposed in this paper. To analyze the thermal performance of the HHCF, a heat transfer model based on the heat balance method is established and validated by experimental results. Meanwhile, the energy saving potential of a room with the HHCF is evaluated as well. When the HHCF is applied to places where heating is required in the cold season while refrigeration is unnecessary in hot season, the HHCF can reduce the heating need by 40.2% and 21.5% compared with the conventional direct solar heat gain window and the Trombe wall, respectively. Furthermore, a series of parametric analyses are performed to investigate the thermal performance of the room with HHCF under various design and operating conditions. It is found that the thermal performance of the HHCF mainly depends on the window operational schedule, the width and the absorptivity of heat collecting wall, and the thermal performance of the inner double-glass window. The modeling and the parametric study in this paper are beneficial to the design and the optimization of the HHCF in passive solar buildings.  2019 by the authors.","2019","2024-02-20 10:24:02","2024-02-20 10:24:02","","","","6","12","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12061038","Architectural design; Structural design; Cost effectiveness; Facades; Walls (structural partitions); Energy utilization; Energy conservation; Solar heating; Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, designing an energy-efficient HVAC system is essential to alleviate the worsening greenhouse effect. Recent research works have reported that geothermal energy coupled with optimal insulation is the best approach in minimising the energy consumption. Thus, we attempted to analyse the thermal performance of a naturally-ventilated underground shelter in a hot and humid country such as Malaysia. We proposed an optimal design to enhance the sustainability of the low-energy building. The model was numerically simulated using CFD, and a statistical surrogate model was implemented for obtaining the optimal design. The findings indicated that the room temperature of the shelter was significantly lower than the outdoor temperature during the hottest month and vice-versa during the coldest month. Moreover, the proposed optimal design showed about 3.4% increase in ventilation rate and about 2.8% decrease in room temperature as compared to the previous design.

In this paper, a three-step approach is used to develop and evaluate prediction models. Firstly, the Latin Hypercube Sampling Method (LHSM) is used to generate a representative 19-dimensional design database and DesignBuilder is then used to obtain the thermal load and discomfort degree hours through simulation. Secondly, samples from the database are used to develop and validate seven prediction models, using data mining approaches including multilinear regression (MLR), chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID), exhaustive CHAID (ECHAID), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function network (RBFN), classification and regression trees (CART), and support vector machines (SVM). It is found that the MLR and BPNN models outperform the others in the prediction of thermal load with average absolute error of less than 1.19%, and the BPNN model is the best at predicting discomfort degree hour with 0.62% average absolute error. Finally, two hybrid modelsMLR (MLR + BPNN) and MLR-BPNNare developed. The MLR-BPNN models are found to be the best prediction models, with average absolute error of 0.82% in thermal load and 0.59% in discomfort degree hour.  2018 by the authors.

It reviews the state of the art of current body of literature about the application of DSF technologies in order to provide guidelines to optimise such designs in naturally ventilated buildings. Three groups of parameters are identified as having significant impact on the DSF performance: the 'facade' parameters, which comprise the features of the cavity and the external layer of the facade; the 'building' parameters, which are those related to the physical configurations of the building; and the 'site' parameters, which are related to the effects of the outdoor environmental conditions on the building and the DSF behaviours. For each group of parameters, a comprehensive table is compiled summarizing the main findings of the studies that directly and indirectly contribute to the understanding and implementation of such technology. Guidelines established for the design of naturally ventilated buildings indicated potential application of DSF for improving the indoor thermal comfort even in warmer regions. However, further investigations expanding the analysis beyond the cavity are needed in order to evaluate the influence of the DSF on the thermal comfort in the user space.  2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of solving this problem, the authors proposed numerical optimization algorithms based on conditionally extreme methods of mathematical programming. The problem of conditional minimization is reduced to a problem of an unconditional extreme using two modified Lagrange functions. The advantage of the proposed methodology is a wide range of convergence, the absence of requirements for convexity of functions on an admissible set of variation parameters, as well as high convergence, which can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the objective and constraint functions. Verification of the developed methodology was carried out by solving a well-known example of ten-bar truss optimization. A comparison of the results obtained by other sources with the copyright ones confirmed the effectiveness of the presented algorithms. As an example, the problems of optimizing the cross-section of a steel beam have also been solved. Automation of the algorithms is performed in mathematical package MathCAD, which allows you to visually trace the sequence of commands, as well as obtain graphs that reflect the state of the task at each iteration. Thus, the authors obtained an original methodology for solving the optimization problem of flat bar structures, which can be extended to solve the problem of optimal design of general structures, where the optimality criterion is defined as material consumption, and the given structural requirements are presented as constraint functions.  2022 St-Petersburg State Polytechnical University.

In many cases the piled rafts settlements are likely to be large, which leads to an increase of the pile length and/or number of piles required to reduce the settlements. However, this increase does not satisfy the design requirements or an economical design. The majority of piled raft foundations has been designed with a uniform pile length and configuration. This paper describes the process of optimizing the design of a piled raft foundation for a high rise building in the Mazandaran province in Iran by considering an economical design methodology in which piles are placed more densely beneath the maximum load positions when the piled raft is subjected to non-uniform loads. By using the ELPLA software in the analysis process, the validity of the software is examined through the results of a report prepared on behalf of Technical Committee TC18 on piled foundations. The study shows that the pile arrangement method can help to considerably reduce the total and differential settlements with similar total pile length as well as the induced bending moments and shear forces of the raft. This study can help practicing engineers to choose pile and raft parameters with the pile arrangement method to produce an economical design.  2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","2016","2024-02-20 10:24:04","2024-03-25 11:19:09","","75-85","","1","34","","Geotechnical and Geological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer International Publishing","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\UZLFREZX\Rabiei and Choobbasti - 2016 - Piled Raft Design Strategies for High Rise Buildin.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10706-015-9929-x","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Piles; Pile foundations; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 3_Weight/Mass; 2_Others (Not Specified); 7_Part of building (Piled raft)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Featuring robotic systems that grasp, manipulate, and finally position building components according to a precise digital blueprint, RTC combines robotic assembly procedures and advanced digital design of non-standard timber structures. The resulting architectural morphologies allow for a convergence of aesthetic and functional concerns, enabling structural optimisation through the locally differentiated aggregation of material. Initiated by the group of Gramazio Kohler Research at ETH Zurich, this approach offers a new perspective on automated timber construction, where the focus is shifted from the processing of single parts towards the assembly of generic members in space. As such, RTC promotes unique advantages over conventional approaches to timber construction, such as, for example, CNC joinery and cutting: through the automated placement of material exactly where it is needed, RTC combines additive and largely waste-free construction with economic assembly procedures, it does not require additional external building reference, and it offers digital control across the entire building process, even when the design and assembly information are highly complex. This paper considers 1) research parameters for the individual components of RTC (such as computational design processes, construction methods and fabrication strategies), and 2) the architectural implications of integrating these components into a systemic, unifying process at the earliest stages of design. Overall, RTC leads to profound changes in the design, performance and expressive language of architecture and thus fosters the creation of architecture that profoundly reinvents its constructive repertoire.  2015 Elsevier B.V.

Existing studies mainly focused on NZEBs theories and simulations. However, the building design procedures, and operational status are typically unknown. To address this research gap, we proposed a design and performance validation framework and investigated critical factors. The framework was divided into four stages and was applied to a case study. In design evaluation, an integrated design approach with building simulation was suggested to iteratively optimize design decisions. After the construction of the building, the first-year real energy data were utilized to justify the net-zero effectiveness. The intensive monitored data revealed performance gaps between energy model prediction and measurement. To track the performance consistency, energy data from the fifth year were studied comprehensively. Finally, a series of effective design options and operation improvement strategies were recommended. We found that the occupants behavior, climate difference and mechanical system conditions were the most important factors affecting the accuracy of the predictive model. The sub-metering system enabled energy model calibration and detected possible malfunctions. An intelligently designed lighting system and energy-conscious occupants could maximize the benefits of daylight harvesting.

For zero energy and Zero Emission Buildings (ZEB), photovoltaic solar energy systems are often installed. When the goal is to build a life cycle Zero Emission Building, all emissions come under scrutiny. Emissions from photovoltaic (PV) energy systems in Zero Emission Buildings have been shown to have a relative large share of material emissions. In this paper, we compare GHG emissions per kW h of electricity and greenhouse gas emission payback times (GPBT) for three residential PV systems in Zero Emission Pilot Buildings in Norway. All the buildings have roof mounted PV systems with different design solutions. The objective is to analyse the emission loads and GPBT of these three systems to facilitate for more informed choices of energy systems for Zero Emission Buildings. The results show that the total embodied emissions allocated per square meter of module area are around 150-350 kg CO2 eq/m2 for the three different systems. Emissions from the mounting systems vary from 10 to 25 kg CO2 eq/m2 depending on the material types and quantities used. When modules replace other roofing materials, such as roof tiles, mounting emissions were reduced by approximately 60%. GHG emissions per kW h electricity produced were in the range of 30-120 g CO2 eq/kW h for the different systems. The system with the lowest emissions was the largest system, which had a simple mounting structure and modules with reused cells. It was found that the GPBT was strongly dependent on the scenario used for electricity grid emissions. By applying a dynamic emission payback scenario with an optimistic reduction of emissions from the European electricity grid, the GPBT was 3-8 years for the different systems. When comparing the emissions with current Norwegian hydropower emissions, of around 20 g CO2 eq/kW h, it was found that all of the PV system's emissions were higher. When compared to a mainly fossil fuel based grid, all the PV system's emissions are low. This study highlights the importance of reliable emission documentation for PV modules and their mounting structures on the market.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2024-02-20 10:24:04","2024-02-20 10:24:04","","155-171","","","133","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.03.063","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Building materials; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roofs; Electric power transmission networks; Solar power generation; Housing; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Solar energy; Solar panels; Mountings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

However, this multifaceted approach unavoidably increases the dimension of the problem and comes with a prohibitively high computational cost. Hierarchical decomposition divides an optimization problem into several interconnected subproblems, and each subproblem has its objectives and constraints. Therefore, a complex problem is represented by a series of manageable subproblems. However, solving subproblems may lead to the local optimal solutions of the original problem. This research proposes a hierarchical decomposition approach that can achieve global optimal solutions. The proposed approach is applied to a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the carbon emission and operating cost of building. This problem is decomposed into two subproblems to be solved sequentially. The first subproblem is to minimize the energy consumptions of the building. The second subproblem has the same objectives as the original one, but the search space is the result of the first subproblem. The benefit of decomposing this problem is that only the second problem needs to be solved again when additional energy price and carbon emission scenarios to be considered. A mid-rise residential building is selected as a case study to demonstrate the approach. The results show that the decomposition approach can reduce the number of simulations while keeping the full set of solutions of the original problem. The application of the proposed approach is based on a fixed utility rate, and only two objectives are considered for each level of optimization. These limitations could be overcome by adjusting the way to apply this approach.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:05","2024-02-20 10:24:05","","","","","44","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103272","Architectural design; Carbon; Optimal systems; Structural design; Multiobjective optimization; Decomposition; Utility rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A subset of these collectors is collectors that are integrated into building envelope. The so-called ""building-integrated"" PV/T collectors have seen a dramatic rise in popularity recently. This recent popularity has necessitated systematic design optimization. To benefit design optimization, a review of computer models of these collectors was performed. This review was performed by objectively assessing international findings on roof-integrated and curtain-wall integrated PV/T collectors. The scope of this review was thermal collection efficiency. The significance of this review was to identify the weakest link in computer models that should one day lead to more accurate computer models. This weak link is the internal heat transfer rate. To overcome this weakness, a model calibration method was proposed that is based on case-by-case parameter identification. In addition, a detailed dimensional analysis was performed that allowed a new  group to be introduced to Nusselt (Nu) number correlations of developing, turbulent parallel-plate flow. This  group is the Stanton number as applied to the inter-channel radiative heat transfer coefficient (Str). Commonly implemented Nu number correlations do not account for this heat transfer rate. They only account for collector geometry, collector air flow inertia and collector air viscosity.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by the human nervous system's estimation mechanism, we proposed a data-driven process-based framework for decision-making support. This framework achieves the performance-oriented decision aid under uncertainties based on a general component design, consisting of three parts: the probabilistic surrogate modeling, ensemble modeling, and the model interpretation method. With the characterization of uncertainties into aleatory or epistemic based on the possibility for minimization, the component's design enables the framework to achieve dynamic interaction with users and inference toward higher intelligence to ""make assumptions"" in potential design space. Subsequently, it maps possible consequences of output scenarios to input variants causes by generating informative feedback and ensures a robust prediction under certain flexibility of incomplete inputs. We utilized the framework as an assistance system to conduct the strategic feedback of energy efficiency for building designers in different early design stages: The framework is tested on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data from England and Wales (19,725,379 buildings). The result achieves a comparable forecasting performance as the SOTA machine learning and provides coherent input variants' interpretation. More importantly, during the design process, the framework enables to interactively provide building designers with expected building energy efficiency range in on-going possible design space with intervention consequences and input causes interpretation. Eventually, it drives users to operate toward higher energy-efficient building designs.  2021","2022","2024-02-20 10:24:05","2024-02-20 10:24:05","","","","","307","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118240","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Decision support systems; Uncertainty analysis; Digital storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The central concept of additive construction was defined, and a systematic mapping study was performed in order to assemble relevant publications selected according to a well-defined set of criteria. Knowledge gathered from the relevant publications was organised into four main categories: material science, engineering, building design and market analysis. The lack of focus of material science research towards the characterisation and potential improvement of construction-related material properties has been emphasised. The evolution of technological solutions to deposit the construction materials from gantry solutions to more lightweight systems has been described. The governing parameters for deciding on the most appropriate solutions have been identified as the type of building component, the location for production, and the assembly technique. Benefits of additive construction for building design were shown to mostly address the perspective of end-users, but should instead be understood as the emergence of new opportunities and new constraints that will necessitate a greater degree of rational decision-making in the design phase. The relevant markets for additive construction were shown to be closely related to the inherent specificities of the project in question. This implies that additive construction can be successfully applied in connection with general housing projects only if housing in general changes to become more optimised and more individualised. It was concluded that additive construction has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry, its success depending on how the whole building industry is ready to tackle three challenges: the need for an architectural paradigm shift, the need for a holistic design process, and the need for rational designs. A list of suggestions for further research is provided, among them the development of tools for assessing the disruptive potential of additive construction in an objective and scientific way.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2024-02-20 10:24:05","2024-02-20 10:24:05","","347-366","","","72","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2016.08.026","Architectural design; Structural design; Building materials; Construction; Commerce; Decision making; Construction industry; Housing; 3D printers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this paper suggests a comprehensive framework for the building energy optimization process integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) daylight simulations. A building energy simulation tool, IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA-ICE), was coupled with three open-source tools including GenOpt, OpenFOAM, and Radiance. In the optimization phase, several design variables i.e., building envelope properties, fenestration parameters, and Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system set points, were selected to minimize the total building energy use and simultaneously improve thermal and visual comfort. Two different scenarios were investigated for retrofitting of a generic office building located in Oslo, Norway. In the first scenario a constant air volume (CAV) ventilation system with a local radiator in each zone was used, while an all-air system equipped with a demand control ventilation (DCV) was applied in the second scenario. Findings showed that, compared to the reference design, significant reduction of total building energy use, around 77% and 79% in the first and second scenarios, was achieved respectively, and thermal and visual comfort conditions were also improved considerably. However, the overall thermal and visual comfort satisfactions were higher when all-air system was applied.  2021 by the authors.

The goal is to assess and optimize atrium type and proportions to improve energy efficiency of atrium buildings. This paper investigates daylight metrics in central, attached and semi-enclosed atrium types with different proportions and roof aperture designs, such as monitor and horizontal skylight. Daylight performance is measured based on the proportions of an atrium that are defined by Well Index (WI), used to characterize atria. Climate-Based Daylight Modeling (CBDM) is applied as the assessment strategy with U.S Climate Zone 3 as the climatic setting. Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) and Annual Solar Exposure (ASE) are adopted as the dynamic daylight metrics to compare the results. This study also validates DIVA for Rhino as the simulation tool by comparing daylight results of the computer simulation with the same scale-model. This research applies both scale-model and computer simulation methods to assess daylight and energy performance in atrium buildings based on Well Index. This paper then employs DIVA simulation tool to assess daylight performance based on the Well Index. The results demonstrate that Well Index is a reliable indicator to characterize atrium proportion and confirm that Well Index works with (CBDM). Having assessed the impact of design parameters, such as climate, building thickness, material reflectance, material transmittance, furniture and monitor roof glazing height, the study potentially provides architects with an atrium design database for U.S. Climate Zone 3.

Despite introducing several pathways in this regard, this integration tends to be interfered by the expert opinions and result in a subjective final solution. An example of such pathways is the criteria-based green rating systems. To overcome this challenge this integration can be structured in the form of an optimization problem to objectively spot a set of trade-offs among various sustainability and resilience aspects. These aspects should be in a quantitative form known as indicators. To this end, the present study aims at finding the most-suited indicators each can justify some sustainability and resilience aspects through a comprehensive systematic literature review framework. The main focus of this study is on the building energy domain according to its vital role in global energy consumption to help to reach a design that is not only energy-optimized but also sustainable and resilient. Therefore, all found indicators in this study are directly tied to the building energy domain. The findings of this study can help designers to select the desired sustainability and resilience indicators from the resulting list ready to be applied in an optimization structure to achieve an objective integration of sustainability and resilience into the building energy domain.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:06","2024-02-20 10:24:06","","","","","44","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102974","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Integration; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tree cover, adjacent buildings, and micro-climate effects caused by the larger surrounding area can all yield deviations in air temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, and wind that are large enough to influence design and operation decisions. In order to overcome this challenge, there are many prior studies on developing weather forecasting algorithms from micro-to meso-scales.

There is a dire need for enhancing the energy efficiency of building to limit their demand for operating energy as this leads to enhanced reductions in environmental impacts. Of particular relevance to the amount of energy utilised in a building during the operation phase is the nature of material and size of components utilised in the building. In this work, a mathematical programming framework is presented to optimise a number of building design objective functions, including heat gain, daylight and economic cost of material utilised. The variables that are focussed on in this study are the sizes of windows, type of material adopted for the building, embodied in the construction building systems used for various building components, and the type of lighting adopted. To validate the framework, two realistic case studies obtained from an industry partner are adopted and solved via the use of the proposed mathematical programming method. Results indicate that compared to the solutions proposed by an experienced engineer, the daylight, heating and cost of the building is enhanced by up to 39%, 43% and 23% respectively.

The review provides background on the simulation tools and applicable data-analysis methods currently available to the building industry for both design-oriented and control-oriented optimization approaches of various energy systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper reviews the capabilities of these toolsets, as well as their suitability for use by industry professionals, and academic researchers. Reviewed studies show significant annual energy savings and peak load shifting potential for integrated system optimization within buildings. However, the available toolsets and frameworks are not suitable to readily perform multi-objective combined optimizations that integrate a wide range of building energy systems at industry scale. To maximize the efficiency of these systems and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by buildings in accordance with goals set forth by nations across the world, a comprehensive and easy-to-use combined design and control-oriented optimization tool that interfaces easily with geometric architectural design tools is needed for the building simulation industry. Moreover, optimization-based building energy modeling and simulation tools that consider utility driven demand response and peak load management, would be beneficial for designing and operating a built environment that is resilient and sustainable. The case studies reviewed in this paper confirm the limited studies of energy simulation optimizations that have simultaneously analyzed design and control elements of building energy systems prior to construction.

Artificial neural networks (ANN), due to their potential to capture building energy systems complex interactions are regarded as powerful surrogate models; however, the definition of optimal ANN structures and hyperparameters have been overlooked causing substandard prediction performance. The aim of this study is to present a novel hybrid neuro-genetic modelling framework developed as an open source tool capable of identifying optimal multi-input/multi-output ANN structures for accurately predicting building thermodynamic performance. The ANN optimisation process uses a genetic algorithm that minimises the root mean squared error (RMSE) data difference between the target and predicted values for both the training and testing data. As a case study, an archetype social house located in different climatic regions in Mexico is used. The ANN training database has been generated by simulating a sample of high-resolution energy models considering a combination of different active and passive energy strategies (input data) while calculating building exergy destructions, occupant thermal comfort and life cycle cost (output data). After automatically evaluating thousands of different structures, the neuro-genetic tool has identified a single deep ANN structure (3 hidden layers with 18, 17, 20 neurons respectively) capable of predicting the model's high output variability, achieving a prediction accuracy >0.95 for each of the outputs.

To improve the accuracy and efficiency, we aim to propose the intelligent optimization method, a user-friendly framework to automatize the whole energy-efficient design process from building information modelling to decision-making. Parametric programming and interface program design are adopted to realize the function of adaptive cooperative adjustment modelling and real time automatic data interaction between different modules with design efficiency enhanced. A decision-making method based on Self-Organizing Map clustering integrated with NSGA-II optimization algorithm is proposed to increase the accuracy of energy-efficient design. An experiment is performed to assess the effectiveness from design accuracy and efficiency as well as applicability with evaluation factors put forward. The experiment is carried out on a typical building in severe cold regions by comparing with two commonly used methods of subjective decision-making design and simulation aided design. The results show that the proposed framework is applicable by architects and performs better in design accuracy and efficiency compared with the other two methods. The performance levels of the compared three objectives are improved by 25.23%, 9.84%, 3.87% respectively and 87.5% time of a day is saved for architects to do other work. Thus, the intelligent optimization framework is a promising method to automatize the multi-objective optimization process of daylighting and energy performances by architects with both design accuracy and efficiency enhanced. The effectiveness evaluation method of different frameworks using experiment will benefit the selection and development of more applicable tools used by architects in future.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:09","2024-02-20 10:24:09","","","","","43","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102804","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Conformal mapping; Multiobjective optimization; Daylighting; Self organizing maps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a comprehensive review, this study identified three critical issues that affect the implementation of the BPO process in the early design stage: model integration, real-time performance analysis, and interactive optimization design. This study provides a systematic solution to these three critical issues. In terms of model integration, a feature-based and graph-based 3D building space recognition algorithm is proposed to automatically convert the computer-aided design (CAD model) into a computer-aided engineering model (CAE model). In terms of real-time performance analysis, a simplified physical method, an HPC-accelerated method, and an AI-based method are explored, and a real-time energy modeling module and a real-time daylighting analysis module are developed. In terms of the interactive optimization design, a preference-based multi-objective BPO design algorithm that can consider user preferences is proposed to make full use of the decision-making ability of humans and the computing power of machines and significantly improve the optimization efficiency and result satisfaction. Based on the systematic solution, a multi-objective BPO design software, MOOSAS, is developed. MOOSAS allows real-time performance feedback, dynamic parameter analysis, and interactive optimization, supporting the BPO process in the early design stage. The innovations of this study are as follows: first, this study proposes a systematic solution to the three critical issues of the BPO process, i.e., model integration, real-time performance analysis, and interactive optimization design; second, this study develops a multi-objective BPO design software (MOOSAS) for the early design stage.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:10","2024-02-20 10:24:10","","","","","200","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107929","Architectural design; Structural design; Computer aided engineering; Computer aided design; Decision making; Multiobjective optimization; Integration; Energy utilization; Daylighting; Three dimensional computer graphics; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Graphic methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, evaluating community disaster impact requires consideration of loss interdependency among different buildings, which could be a complex task. Furthermore, implementing a community-level objective to design safety level determination requires the establishment of feasible methods to calculate it in a reasonable time. This paper develops a simple and viable framework for community-level objective-based design safety target optimization for multiple building classes subjected to seismic hazard. To reduce the computation cost, the framework employs an efficient procedure of using an artificial neural network to approximate the seismic response of buildings with common characteristics (occupancy use, and type and size of lateral resisting system). The methodology is illustrated for optimizing the target reliability indices of office and hospital building classes exposed to seismic hazard, with minimizing regional economic cost as objective. Simple loss and interdependency models are used for this illustration due to lack of available complex models, which can be replaced by more recent and complex models to improve accuracy of the analysis once they become available.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:10","2024-02-20 10:24:10","","","","","91","","Structural Safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2021.102097","Architectural design; Reliability; Costs; Hazards; Neural networks; Seismic response; Economics; Disasters; Complex networks; Regional planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The atmosphere is overloaded with carbon dioxide caused by fossil fuels that are burned for energy. Almost 40 percent of the total energy worldwide is used by the building sector, which comes from non-renewable sources and contributes up to 30% of annual greenhouse gas emissions globally. The building sector in Iran accounts for 33.8% of Irans total energy usage. Within the building sector, the energy consumption of Iranian educational buildings is 2.5 times higher than educational buildings in developed countries. One of the most effective ways of reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is retrofitting existing buildings. This study aims to investigate whether a particular energy-optimized design under the present climate conditions would respond effectively to future climate change. This can help designers make a better decision on an optimal model, which can remain optimal over the years based on climate change. For methodological purposes, multistage optimization was used to retrofit an existing educational building. Specifically, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was chosen to minimize the cooling and heating load, as well as consider investment costs for present and future weather files, using the jEPlus tool. Furthermore, the TOPSIS method was used to identify the best set of retrofit measures. For this purpose, a four-story educational building in Tehran was modeled on Design Builder software as a case study to provide a better understanding for researchers of how to effectively retrofit a building to achieve a nearly zero energy building considering climate change. The results show that the optimized solution for the present weather file does not remain the optimized solution in 2080. Moreover, it is shown that to have an optimized building in regard to future weather files, the model should be designed for the future weather conditions. This study shows that if the building becomes optimized using the present weather file the total energy consumption will be reduced by 65.14% and 86.18% if using the future weather file. These two figures are obtained by implementing active and passive measures and show the priority of using the future weather file for designers. Using PV panels also, this building is capable of becoming a nearly net zero building, which would produce about 90% of its own energy demands.  2022 by the author.","2022","2024-02-20 10:24:10","2024-02-20 10:24:10","","","","3","15","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15030983","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Energy utilization; Investments; Retrofitting; Climate models; Zero energy buildings; Climate change; Fossil fuels; School buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the execution of improving buildings' energy performance actions is a primary approach to reduce energy dissipation. Building simulation-based optimization is a popular tool for this task; however, it requires the direct coupling of a simulation model with an optimization algorithm that involves intensive and laborious computation. This study aims to reduce computational costs by proposing an optimization procedure based on combining surrogate models with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the building's energy consumption and its occupants' thermal comfort simultaneously. The case study of an existing office building in Kermanshah, Iran was selected to implement and evaluate this suggested optimization strategy. In this study, the input variables are chosen so that, for the studied building, they could be changed without difficulty and high costs. EnergyPlus simulates the situations set by design-of-experiments. The best subsets regression method identifies the regression models which could fit the simulation results with as few factors as possible. These regression models are implemented inside the NSGA-II algorithm for optimization. The optimal solution results show that using the applied multi-objective optimization method, it is possible to decrease the building's annual gas and electricity consumption, compared to the baseline case, by up to 21.3% and 9.7%, respectively, while keeping up the indoor environment in the limit of the thermal comfort zone.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","","","","41","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102440","Architectural design; Structural design; Evolutionary algorithms; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Regression analysis; Multiobjective optimization; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Thermal comfort; Design of experiments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this aim, a research strategy consisting of literature review, case studies and survey questionnaire is designed to accomplish four objectives. First, to examine the concepts of design process, building performance, RM and BIM; second, to present three case studies to explain the role of using RM and BIM capabilities towards optimising building performance; third, to investigate the perception and application of architectural design firms in Egypt towards the role of RM and BIM for enhancing building performance during the design process; and finally, to develop a framework integrating RM and BIM during the design process as an approach for optimising building performance. Findings: Through literature review, the research identified 18 risks that hamper optimising building performance during the design process. In addition, 11 building performance values and 20 BIM technologies were defined. Results of data analysis showed that ""Design budget overrun"", ""Lack of considering life cycle cost"" and ""Inefficient use of the design time"" were ranked the highest risks that affect the optimisation of building performance. Respondents ranked ""Risk avoid"" or ""Risk transfer"" as the most risk responses adopted in the Egyptian context. In addition, ""BIM As Built"" was ranked the highest BIM technology used for overcoming risks during the design process. These findings necessitated taking action towards developing a framework to optimising building performance. Originality/value: The research identified the risks that affect optimising building performance during the design process. It focuses on improving the design process through using the capabilities of BIM technologies towards overcoming these risks during the design process. The proposed framework which integrates RM and BIM represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.  2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","1233-1267","","6","19","","Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0246","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Budget control; Information theory; Risk assessment; Information management; Surveys; Risk management; Risk analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim is to support the decision-makers during the building design process by including uncertainties from the design phase, quantifying the probability of attaining the energy performance criteria and financial requirements. The method is meant to be used as a comparative study of optional building designs based on different stakeholder values and consequence models to quantify the economic consequences of failing to comply with energy requirements. A case study using single-family houses demonstrated the various applications of the method using two design options as examples for quantifying the probability of failure and the probability of a design option being more financially viable than the other. The energy performance was simulated based on fifteen stochastic parameters, and the cost evaluation was simulated using six stochastic parameters from three stakeholders with different values and two different consequence models. The results showed a difference between stakeholders in the case study; the cheaper option was more suitable for the property developer while the more expensive option was a better choice for the private building owner if a longer lifecycle was expected.  2021 The Author(s)","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","","","","252","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111434","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Stochastic systems; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Risk analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this work is to improve the designer's control on thermal and geometric variables of the building in the first stages of the design process, to obtain an optimized building from different points of view. An innovative computational performance-driven design optimization workflow is proposed. The integration of a parametric algorithmic modelling tool in a genetic algorithm powered performance optimization procedure allows to minimize energy need and construction cost of the building, and to optimize the natural illumination levels, affecting several geometric variables. This approach is tested on the early design stages for the new construction of an educational building located in the centre of Italy (L'Aquila). The results are post-processed in order to provide an innovative graphical visualization of the outputs to improve the decision-making process. Useful insights on the influence of different design choices on three key performance indicators can be drawn for the case study building, by comparison of the Pareto solutions: optimization results highlight the strongest influence of window-to-wall ratio, among the other variables, on energy need and useful daylight illuminance.  2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","","","","239","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110857","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Benchmarking; Construction; Energy efficiency; Decision making; Multiobjective optimization; Thermal insulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Canada, almost 70% of the total energy used by the commercial and institutional sectors was consumed by Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems, which makes them the main targets of energy performance optimization methods. Furthermore, based on a governmental report, 40% of Quebec university buildings are in poor or very poor shape regarding structure and materials, and require immediate renovation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to reduce energy consumption, and this can be accomplished by improving the design of new buildings or by renovating existing ones. Moreover, Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization (SBMO) models can be used for optimizing and assessing different renovation scenarios considering Total Energy Consumption (TEC) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC). The time-consuming nature of SBMO has triggered the development of simplified and surrogate models within the design process. This study proposes a generative deep learning building energy model using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which could potentially overcome the current limitations. The proposed VAEs extract deep features from a whole building renovation dataset and generate renovation scenarios considering TEC and LCC of the existing institutional buildings. The proposed model also has the generalization ability due to its potential to reuse the dataset from a specific case in similar situations. The performance of the developed model has been demonstrated using a simulated renovation dataset to prove its potential. The results show that using generative VAEs is acceptable considering computational time and accuracy.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","","","","230","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110520","Architectural design; Structural design; Life cycle; Costs; Learning systems; Neural networks; Multiobjective optimization; Energy utilization; Air conditioning; Deep learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model free-form building's surface was divided into finite elements by generating a mesh using Grasshopper, which is an add-in program of Rhinoceros. Geometric information was extracted from each finite element and used to estimate the heat gain and loss characteristics of the whole free-form building. A free-form building shape optimization process was proposed based on the genetic algorithm (GA). Its applicability was demonstrated by deriving the optimized shape of the model free-form building for various climate zones. Established models that returned the thermal characteristics of a free-form building were used as objective functions, which are critical in the GA optimization process. The results showed that the proposed process could rapidly predict and optimize the variation of the heat gain and loss characteristics that was caused by changing the building shape.  2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","473-482","","","85","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.09.080","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Finite element method; Climate models; Thermal load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a hierarchical coupled optimization method for cross-sectoral synergistic planning for supply and demand sides of urban energy systems. It integrates thermal load simulation of different demand-side energy-saving retrofits based on state space method with mixed integer linear programming of whole energy systems. This method enables reduced-order description of the time-varying multidimensional process while preserving the dynamic characteristics of demand-side to solve the problems of precision and scale difference in simulation and optimization. The case study shows that the optimal demand-side strategy enables 48.20% building energy-saving, while the optimal supply-side technology enables 36.77% emission reduction throughout the year. The emission reduction rate of the whole systems can be further increased by 6.16%30.42% after the combination of passive and active energy-saving means. Meanwhile, compared with the baseline scenario, the synergistic optimization solutions in this case results in a 24.22% decrease in net present value of cost and a 50.35% decrease in total carbon emission. This means that the energy-saving and emission reduction potential of the integrated systems can be further exploited through the integration of multiple building retrofit strategies and renewable technologies. This hierarchical approach helps to design effective cross-sector synergistic solutions that achieve a reasonable trade-off of economic benefits and environmental sustainability of the whole systems. Overall, this study integrates different models and approaches of the supply and demand sectors to provide flexible and integrated solutions for low-carbon design and operation management of urban energy systems with building energy-saving retrofit.  2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:24:11","2024-02-20 10:24:11","","","","","258","","Energy Conversion and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115497","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Sustainable development; State space methods; Integer programming; Investments; Energy conservation; Retrofitting; Hierarchical systems; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is important to investigate the reasons that cause algorithms to be ineffective in BEO. This study begins with a systematic definition of optimization algorithms ineffectiveness, describing five ineffective scenarios. Then, a reference building and a representative energy optimization problem are proposed. Four commonly used optimization algorithms, namely, discrete Armijo gradient, Hooke-Jeeves, particle swarm optimization with constriction coefficient (PSOCC) and particle swarm optimization with inertia weight (PSOIW), are tested to determine the circumstances and the causal factors under which they become ineffective. The results shed more light on the performance of algorithms in BEO and can be used to help designers avoid ineffective algorithms.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:24:12","2024-02-20 10:24:12","","1295-1306","","","134","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.057","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Intelligent buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies tend to neglect the pressure loss of exfiltration process and its impact on optimal design of EAIW. This paper quantitatively estimates the pressure loss of exfiltration process and proposes a methodology to determine the optimal design for maximizing energy saving potential of EAIW. In this study, a network heat transfer model was validated and used to calculate the hourly cooling and heating load of EAIW. The pressure loss of exfiltration process and its related energy consumption was estimated by Darcy's law. The optimal design was identified for minimizing the overall annual energy consumption of EAIW in different climates. Influences of exfiltration velocity and porous material selection on the optimal design of EAIW were investigated. The results demonstrate the pressure loss of exfiltration process significantly affects the overall energy performance and optimal design of EAIW. The optimal thickness of porous material component are 40 mm, 50 mm, and 50 mm for three climate zones, which correspond to a minimum annual overall energy consumption of 0.51 kWh/m2, 0.48 kWh/m2, and 0.49 kWh/m2, respectively. The porous materials with high permeability and thermal resistance are recommended as air-permeable component of EAIW.

After the optimization, the daylighting performance metric UDI is increased by 38.7%, 31.6%, and 28.8%, and the energy performance metric EUI is decreased by 20.2%, 18.5%, and 17.9% compared to average performance values. Sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the relationship between design variables and performance metrics. The skylight width and length are the most important variables for all locations, while the influence of the other variables varies greatly.  2019 International Solar Energy Society","2019","2024-02-20 10:24:13","2024-02-20 10:24:13","","7-18","","","191","","Solar Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.08.039","Architectural design; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Geometry; Sustainable development; Sensitivity analysis; Parameter estimation; Daylighting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To promote sustainability, building simulations are widely used in the early design stage to calculate the building performance and optimize the design. However, the high computational burden limits the application of building simulations in daily design work. This paper proposes a hybrid metamodel-based method to facilitate the rapid assessment of a building's energy demand in the early design stage. This method (1) decomposes a complex building mass into several zones as different metamodel variants and characterizes the total energy demand by summing up the energy demands of all the metamodels; (2) uses the received solar radiation values as metamodel input parameters to describe the surrounding shading and reflection effects; (3) employs GPU acceleration technology to accelerate the radiation calculation and reduce the simulation time; and (4) implements a machine learning (ML) algorithm screening framework to enhance the accuracy of the metamodels. Case studies were conducted to demonstrate the proposed method. The results showed that this method could predict the energy demands of buildings in high-density urban environments with acceptable accuracy in a short period of time, which would allow designers to obtain feedback on the building energy demand immediately in the early design stage and opens up more possibilities for achieving low-energy buildings.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:13","2024-02-20 10:24:13","","","","","320","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128825","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy management; Machine learning; Solar radiation; Radiation effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During cooling season in Western China, the climate conditions are characterized by a large daily temperature range and high solar radiation, and improving the thermal storage performance of buildings is an effective passive cooling design strategy for NZEBs. This study aims to investigate the thermal storage performance of building envelopes under free-running conditions. A phase change material (PCM) is integrated in an experimental wallboard to enhance its thermal storage performance. To simulate the thermal environment in free-running buildings, a double-sided periodic thermal effect is applied as the indoor and outdoor conditions during the experiment. Different orders of the material layers and thicknesses of the PCM layer are compared to investigate the key factors that affected the thermal storage performance. The thermal inertia index and coefficient of heat accumulation are employed as key parameters to quantify the two factors. The results indicated that enhancing the coefficient of heat accumulation for the wallboard by optimizing the material layer order can reduce the fluctuations in the indoor air temperature by 31%. However, only increasing the thickness of the heat storage material does not significantly improve the attenuation and time delay effect of the wallboards. The coefficient of heat accumulation is proposed as a key parameter for NZEBs design. The design prototype and key parameters of the thermal storage wall considered in this study may provide a reference for the development of NZEBs in Western China.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-20 10:24:14","2024-02-20 10:24:14","","","","","194","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107709","Architectural design; Structural design; Building materials; Walls (structural partitions); Solar buildings; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Zero energy buildings; Storage (materials); Passive solar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to alleviate the greenhouse effect, it is essential to incorporate a passive system in an underground building to reduce the overall building energy consumption. From the perspective of the indoor occupant, the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) should be maintained at a reasonable level as well if the passive system is used in a building ventilation system. The above problem could be addressed by devising an integrated design procedure that combines both underground building simulation and design optimization methods. The review of this topic, however, is rather scarce in the open literature. Thus, this review paper assesses existing scientific literatures that address the potential influence of building optimization and passive design strategy on the control of IEQ level. The topics covered in this review paper are histories and design considerations of underground buildings, consideration factors required, concept of building ventilation system, IEQ level assessments reported by buildings occupants, critical element in building optimization and passive design strategy in the underground building. From the current review, we have found that integrating both optimization approach and passive design strategy into building performance simulation is a promising technique in improving the IEQ level of the underground building. Moreover, the adoptions of soil and natural ventilation can effectively reduce the energy consumption in underground conditioning system. Indeed, there are several important factors that should be taken into account while designing an underground building. Also, there are a few passive designs that can improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption in underground buildings. All in all, the primary target of this paper is to assist building engineers and designers in designing an energy-efficient underground building. Meanwhile, the acceptable IEQ level could be maintained.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-02-20 10:24:14","2024-02-20 10:24:14","","","","","92","","Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tust.2019.103065","Architectural design; Structural design; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Energy utilization; Ventilation; Thermal comfort; Underground buildings; Greenhouse effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the applicability of PCM as a passive containment cooling system is verified through design and evaluation of the PCM condenser. In addition, the effective heat capacity method is verified for simulating the melting process of PCM in the condition of a reactor accident. The PCM condenser design is optimized with five design parameters; melting point, volume, heat transfer area, effective thermal conductivity, and total heat absorbed. The performance of the PCM condenser is evaluated by containment safety analysis and is compared to that of an active containment cooling system. Although the PCM condenser had a limitation for absorbing only a fixed amount of thermal energy due to the absence of an external heat sink, the PCM condenser shows better performance in the early stage after the accident initiation compared to the single spray system and finally maintains the integrity of the containment building.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-02-20 10:24:14","2024-02-20 10:24:14","","","","","200","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117672","Architectural design; Structural design; Thermal conductivity; Phase change materials; Cooling; Cooling systems; Thermoelectric equipment; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Specific heat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A simple and practical system is proposed, featuring pre-cast textile reinforced concrete shells with a network of prestressed steel tension ties. A non-structural fill is included to provide a level top surface. Building on previous experimental and theoretical work, a complete design methodology is presented. This is then used to explore the structural behaviour of the proposed system, refine its design, and evaluate potential carbon savings. Compared to flat slabs of equivalent structural performance, significant embodied carbon reductions (53–58%) are demonstrated across spans of 6–18 m. Self-weight reductions of 43–53% are also achieved, which would save additional material in columns and foundations. The simplicity of the proposed structure, and conservatism of the design methodology, indicate that further savings could be made with future refinements. These results show that considerable embodied carbon reductions are possible through innovative structural design, and that thin-shell floors are a practical means of achieving this. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; carbon; Carbon; Concrete construction; Concrete shells; concrete structure; design method; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; floor; Floor structures; Floors; Low-carbon buildings; Low-Carbon Buildings; multistorey building; optimization; Precast concrete; reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete; Shells (structures); Structural analysis; Structural optimisation; Structural optimization; Textile reinforced concrete; Textile reinforced concretes; Textiles {Notes} <p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Hawkins, W.; Department of Engineering, United Kingdom; email: wjh35@cam.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2018), www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/mineral-commodity-summaries, U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral commodity summaries (accessed June 2019); Lehne, J., Preston, F., Making Concrete Change: Innovation in Low-carbon Cement and Concrete (2018), Chatham House Reports; Boden, T., Andres, R., Marland, G., Global co2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning, cement manufacture, and gas flaring: 1751–2014 (2017), Oak Ridge National Laboratory; IEA, Energy Technology Perspectives 2008: Scenarios & Strategies to 2050 (2008), OECD/International Energy Agency; Wang, T., Müller, D.B., Graedel, T., Forging the anthropogenic iron cycle (2007) Environ Sci Technol, 41, pp. 5120-5129; <br/>Shanks, W., Dunant, C., Drewniok, M.P., Lupton, R., Serrenho, A., Allwood, J.M., How much cement can we do without? lessons from cement material flows in the UK (2019) Resour Conserv Recycl, 141, pp. 441-454;<br/>Cullen, J.M., Allwood, J.M., Bambach, M.D., Mapping the global flow of steel: From steelmaking to end-use goods (2012) Environ Sci Technol, 46, pp. 13048-13055;<br/>Abergel, T., Dean, B., Dulac, J., Towards a zero-emission, efficient, and resilient buildings and construction sector: Global Status Report 2017 (2017), Technical Report UN Environment and International Energy Agency; Allwood, J.M., Ashby, M.F., Gutowski, T.G., Worrell, E., Material efficiency: A white paper (2011) Resour Conserv Recycl, 55, pp. 362-381;<br/>Griffin, P., Hammond, G., Norman, J., Prospects for emissions reduction in the uk cement sector (2014) Proc Instit Civil Eng: Energy, 167, pp. 152-161;<br/>www.structuralengineersdeclare.com, UK strucutral engineers declare climate & biodiversity emergency, Online. 2019.

The structural efficiency of a gridshell is determined by its shape, which is traditionally designed using form-finding techniques. However, these techniques are primarily used to generate structures in pure tension or compression for a single load case only. In cases where classic form-finding techniques are not applicable, such as for cantilevering gridshells or simply supported gridshells, numerical optimization can be used to find a suitable shape. In this paper, an optimization procedure is proposed that optimizes the shape of a strained gridshell for a given grid. The forces applied to erect the gridshell are chosen as the design variables. These erection forces are optimized to minimize the so-called end-compliance, which is defined as the inner product of the external loads and the resulting displacements. The method of moving asymptotes is adopted to solve the optimization problem and implicit dynamic relaxation is used to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations. Geometric nonlinearity is taken into account by using co-rotational beam elements to model the gridshell laths. To validate the proposed approach, a 6×6 m2 prototype was built. The results show that this approach allows the structure to be optimized considering multiple load cases, while accounting for practical building constraints, and potential designer constraints. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Active bending; architectural design; bending; building construction; Co-rotational beams; construction method; Form finding; Form-finding; Geometric non-linearity; Method of moving asymptotes; Non-linear equilibrium equation; Nonlinear equations; Numerical optimizations; optimization; Reticulated shell structure; shape; Shape optimization; Strained gridshells; structural component; Structural design; Structural efficiencies {Notes} <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Rombouts, J.; KU Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 1 – Box 2431, Belgium; email: jef.rombouts@kuleuven.be</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Douthe, C., Caron, J.F., Baverel, O., Gridshell structures in glass fibre reinforced polymers (2010) Constr Build Mater, 24 (9), pp. 1580-1589; <br/>Liddell, I., Frei otto and the development of gridshells (2015) Case Stud Struct Eng, 4, pp. 39-49;<br/>Harris, R., Romer, J., Kelly, O., Johnson, S., Design and construction of the downland gridshell (2003) Build Res Inform, 31 (6), pp. 427-454;<br/>Harris, R., Haskins, S., Roynon, J., The savill garden gridshell design and construction.

This paper presents a closed-form solution for a minimum weight design problem which may be used at the early-stage design of a high-rise and slender structure. Before considering the weight-based problem, an intervening optimization formulation is introduced in advance which for a fixed amount of material presents an optimal pattern for its distribution. The obtained pattern is then used in the main problem, in which the total weight is considered as the objective function while satisfying the peak lateral deflection constraint and some practical requirements. The flexural stiffness in its general form is selected here as the design variable, so the proposed method is not restricted to a particular system, and any structural system may be addressed. A braced-tube 61-storey building example is presented to be designed based on the proposed technique to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the method. © 2018, Iran University of Science and Technology. {Keywords} Architectural design; Closed form solutions; Constraint satisfaction problems; Drift ratio; Flexural stiffness; Iterative methods; Mathematical method; Minimum weight design; Optimization formulations; Practical requirements; Preliminary design; Stiffness; Structural design; Structural optimization; Tall building; Tall buildings; Total drift ratio {Notes} <p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Rahgozar, R.; Department of Civil Engineering, Iran; email: rahgozar@uk.ac.ir</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Alavi, A., Rahgozar, R., Torkzadeh, P., Hajabasi, M.A., Optimal design of high-rise buildings with respect to fundamental eigenfrequency (2017) Int J Adv Struct Eng, 9 (4), pp. 365-374; <br/>Aldwaik, M., Adeli, H., Advances in optimization of high-rise building structures (2014) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 50 (6), pp. 899-919;<br/>Connor, J.J., Pouangare, C., Simple model for design of framed-tube structures (1991) J Struct Eng, 117 (12), pp. 3623-3644;<br/>Kwan, A., Simple method for approximate analysis of framed tube structures (1994) J Struct Eng, 120 (4), pp. 1221-1239;<br/>Rahgozar, R., Ahmadi, A., Sharifi, Y., A simple mathematical model for approximate analysis of tall buildings (2010) Appl Math Model, 34 (9), pp. 2437-2451;<br/>Rahgozar, R., Malekinejad, M., A simple analytic method for computing the natural frequencies and mode shapes of tall buildings (2012) Appl Math Model, 36 (8), pp. 3419-3432;<br/>Malekinejad, M., Rahgozar, R., An analytical model for dynamic response analysis of tubular tall buildings (2014) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 23 (1), pp. 67-80;<br/>Rahgozar, R., Ahmadi, A.R., Ghelichi, M., Goudarzi, Y., Malekinejad, M., Rahgozar, P., Parametric stress distribution and displacement functions for tall buildings under lateral loads (2014) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 23 (1), pp. 22-41;<br/>Rahgozar, R., Mahmoudzadeh, Z., Malekinejad, M., Rahgozar, P., Dynamic analysis of combined system of framed tube and shear walls by Galerkin method using B-spline functions (2015) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 24 (8), pp. 591-606;<br/>Malekinejad, M., Rahgozar, R., Malekinejad, A., Rahgozar, P., A continuous–discrete approach for evaluation of natural frequencies and mode shapes of high-rise buildings (2016) Int J Adv Struct Eng, 8 (3), pp. 269-280;<br/>Moon, K.S., Connor, J., Fernandez, J., Diagrid structural systems for tall buildings: characteristics and methodology for preliminary design (2007) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 16 (2), pp. 205-230;<br/>Liu, C., Ma, K., Calculation model of the lateral stiffness of high-rise diagrid tube structures based on the modular method (2017) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 26 (4);<br/>Montuori, G.M., Mele, E., Brandonisio, G., Luca, A.D., Design criteria for diagrid tall buildings: Stiffness versus strength (2014) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 23 (17), pp. 1294-1314;<br/>Moon, K.S., Stiffness-based design methodology for steel braced tube structures: a sustainable approach (2010) Eng Struct, 32 (10), pp. 3163-3170;<br/>Chan, C., Huang, M., Kwok, K., Integrated wind load analysis and stiffness optimization of tall buildings with 3D modes (2010) Eng Struct, 32 (5), pp. 1252-1261;<br/>Stromberg, L.L., Beghini, A., Baker, W.F., Paulino, G., Application of layout and topology optimization using pattern gradation for the conceptual design of buildings (2011) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 43 (2), pp. 165-180;<br/>Christensen, P.W., Klarbring, A., (2009) An introduction to structural optimization, , Springer Science, Business Media B.V., Berlin;<br/>(2013) Ultimate 16.0.0, structural analysis program, , Computer and Structures Inc., Berkeley</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\SDEID59Q\Alavi and Rahgozar - 2019 - A Simple Mathematical Method for Optimal Prelimina.pdf","","Architectural design; Iterative methods; Closed form solutions; Constraint satisfaction problems; Drift ratio; Flexural stiffness; Mathematical method; Minimum weight design; Optimization formulations; Practical requirements; Preliminary design; Stiffness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amongst structural materials, steel is characterised by its suitability to a large number of structures as well as a highly pollutant supply chain. Therefore, even a small reduction of the amount of steel currently used in building structures, would undoubtedly be beneficial towards the mitigation of environmental impacts. This paper presents a computational tool that aims to help practitioners to design material-efficient structures for multi-storey buildings frames. The tool is based on an optimisation framework, which –given a small set of input parameters defining the overall frame geometry and the system of loadings– seeks for optimised cross-sections for each structural member, based on a finite set of commercially available section profiles. Results are fully compliant with British and European standards for structural design. The user can therefore quickly and reliably assess a wide range of alternative frame layouts in a nearly real-time frame. To avoid misleading the decision-maker with very definite numbers, both structural mass and embodied carbon coefficients are considered along with their uncertainty through Montecarlo simulation. The final output consists of a probability density function of the embodied carbon for the specific structural design under consideration. The mathematical model which underpins the tool has been extensively validated. Results of an application to a practical example show a carbon emissions reduction potential of 23%. To maximise the impact of the research findings, the described work has been implemented into a plug-in tool for a widely used CAD software. This will help practitioners to take into account embodied carbon consideration early on in the design process when the room for improvement is greatest and the economic repercussions of design changes are low. This tool represents a fundamental first step to translate research on embodied carbon reduction into a means that is useful to, and usable by, industry professionals to mitigate building-related carbon emissions and progress towards national and international carbon targets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon; Computational methods; Computer aided design; Decision making; Design; Early stage; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Emission control; Frame; GHG emission; GHG Emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Optimisation; Optimisations; Parametric; Probability density function; Steel; Structural design; Supply chains {Notes} <p>Cited By :13</p>; <p>CODEN: ENEBD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: D'Amico, B.; School of Engineering and the Built Environment, United Kingdom; email: b.damico@napier.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: EC, Roadmap to a resource efficient europe – Communication from the commission to the european parliament, the council, the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions COM (2011), European Commission; EEA, Material Resources and Waste – 2012 Update (2012), European Environment Agency, Copenhagen; Khasreen, M.M., Banfill, P.F., Menzies, G.F., Life-cycle assessment and the environmental impact of buildings: a review (2009) Sustainability, 1 (3), pp. 674-701; <br/>Pomponi, F., Moncaster, A., Scrutinising embodied carbon in buildings: the next performance gap made manifest (2017) Renew.

In this regard, three different structures are considered; 5-, 10-, and 15-story buildings. Seven mainshock–aftershock sequences are selected from the Iranian accelerogram database for analyzing the structures. By implementing an advanced two-step optimization method, buildings equipped with the active vibration control system (linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm) are designed to withstand all events of mainshock–aftershock sequences. In the first optimization step, a multi-objective optimization with the genetic algorithm is performed and a set of optimal Pareto front results is obtained. In the next step, the life-cycle cost of each optimal design sample of the Pareto front is calculated by considering the cumulative damage and the design sample with the minimum cost is selected as a final optimal property. The results prove that the active vibration control system is capable of reducing structural responses, including acceleration, drift, and residual drift under mainshock–aftershock sequences, and consequently the life-cycle cost of buildings, especially the taller ones. In addition, obtaining the building design variables (story stiffness and yielding force) and active LQR algorithm properties simultaneously leads to a slightly softer final building model than the conventional structure designed by the common building design code. Moreover, it is revealed that, by considering the aftershocks, the building life-cycle cost increases significantly. © The Author(s) 2018. {Keywords} Active control; Active vibration control systems; Aftershock sequence; Architectural design; Building performance; Control systems; Conventional structures; Costs; Earthquakes; Genetic algorithms; Integrated optimization; Life cycle; life-cycle cost; Lifecycle costs; LQR algorithm; mainshock–aftershock sequence; multi-objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Shape optimization; Structural design; Two-step optimizations; Vibration control {Notes} <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>CODEN: JVCOF</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Bakhshi, A.; Department of Civil Engineering, Iran; email: bakhshi@sharif.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2016) Specification for Structural Steel Buildings; <br/>Amadio, C., Fragiacomo, M., Rajgelj, S., The effects of repeated earthquake ground motions on the non-linear response of SDOF systems (2003) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 32 (2), pp. 291-308;<br/>Ansari, A., Noorzad, A., Zafarani, H., Correction of highly noisy strong motion records using a modified wavelet de-noising method (2010) Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 30 (11), pp. 1168-1181;<br/>Ansari, A., Noorzad, A., Zare, M., Application of wavelet multi-resolution analysis for correction of seismic acceleration records (2007) Journal of Geophysics and Engineering, 4 (4), pp. 362-377;<br/>(2016) Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures;<br/>Baker, J.W., Quantitative classification of near-fault ground motions using wavelet analysis (2007) Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 97 (5), pp. 1486-1501;<br/>Boore, D.M., Bommer, J.J., Processing of strong-motion accelerograms: Needs, options and consequences (2005) Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 25 (2), pp. 93-115;<br/>Castaldo, P., De Iuliis, M., Optimal integrated seismic design of structural and viscoelastic bracing-damper systems (2014) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 43 (12), pp. 1809-1827;<br/>Castaldo, P., Palazzo, B., Della Vecchia, P., Life cycle-cost and seismic reliability analysis of 3D systems equipped with FPS for different isolation degrees (2016) Engineering Structures, 125, pp. 349-363;<br/>Chopra, A.K., (2011) Dynamics of Structures—Theory and Applications on Earthquake Engineering, , London, Prentice Hall;<br/>Cimellaro, G.P., Soong, T.T., Reinhorn, A.M., Integrated design of inelastic controlled structural systems (2009) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 16 (7-8), pp. 689-702;<br/>Ehrgott, M., Multiobjective optimization (2008) AI Magazine, 29 (4), pp. 47-57;<br/>(2001) Hazus-MH MR5—Technical Manual: Advanced Engineering Building Module, , Washington DC, Federal Emergency Management Agency;<br/>Grünthal, G., The up-dated earthquake catalogue for the German Democratic Republic and adjacent areas—Statistical data characteristics and conclusions for Hazard assessment (1985) 3Rd International Symposium on the Analysis of Seismicity and Seismic Risk, , (eds.

The design process should ideally be linear, where each discipline receives a complete design from the previous. In reality, however, upstream revisions are usually substantive: significant work in the schematic design and design development phases are due to resolving upstream issues. That said, within the conceptual design and initial phase, the process is mostly linear. This work presents a set of tools that move towards an integrated design optimization, where the building’s form and structure are optimized together and not as separate stages in the design. This approach often results in a higher impact/gain in efficiency, safety, cost-savings, and ultimately results in innovative designs. This industrial application manuscript provides specific details on the implementation and experience gained from the development of various topology optimization tools for use in building engineering. These are all accompanied by examples of their use in applied building projects or more general structural engineering problems. Part of the success of this effort is attributed to the environment in which these tools are implemented, which is friendly to architects. In contrast, commercial tools for this purpose tend to cater to engineers instead. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. {Keywords} Applied optimization; Architectural design; Building engineering; Building projects; Computer aided engineering; Conceptual design; Design development; Engineers; Integrated design optimization; Sequential manners; Shape optimization; Structural engineer; Structural engineering problems; Structural optimization; Topology; Topology optimization; Traditional buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>CODEN: SMOTB</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Zegard, T.; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Chile; email: tzl@ing.puc.cl</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Achtziger, W., On simultaneous optimization of truss geometry and topology (2007) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 33 (4-5), pp. 285-304; <br/>Allaire, G., Francfort, G., A numerical algorithm for topology and shape optimization (1993) Topology Design of Structures, pp. 239-248. , Bendsøe M, Mota Soares C, Springer, Netherlands;<br/>Allaire, G., Kohn, R., Topology optimization and optimal shape design using homogenization (1993) Topology Design of Structures, pp. 207-218. , Bendsøe M, Mota Soares C, Springer, Netherlands;<br/>(2019) Hyperworks, , http://www.altairhyperworks.com/, 2 (accessed January 11 2019);<br/>(2019) Inspire™ 2019, , https://solidthinking.com/product/inspire/, (b), accessed January 11, 2019;<br/>Ambrosio, L., Buttazzo, G., An optimal design problem with perimeter penalization (1993) Calc Var Part Diff Equ, 1 (1), pp. 55-69;<br/>Arora, J., (2011) Introduction to optimum design, , 3, Academic Press, Waltham;<br/>Baker, W.F., Beghini, L.L., Mazurek, A., Carrion, J., Beghini, A., Maxwell’s reciprocal diagrams and discrete Michell frames (2013) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 48 (2), pp. 267-277;<br/>Beghini, L.L., Beghini, A., Katz, N., Baker, W.F., Paulino, G.H., Connecting architecture and engineering through structural topology optimization (2014) Eng Struct, 59, pp. 716-726;<br/>Beghini, L.L., Carrion, J., Beghini, A., Mazurek, A., Baker, W.F., Structural optimization using graphic statics (2014) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 49 (3), pp. 351-366;<br/>Ben-Tal, A., Bendsøe, M., A new method for optimal truss topology design (1993) SIAM J Optim, 3 (2), pp. 322-358;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Optimal shape design as a material distribution problem (1989) Struct Optim, 1 (4), pp. 193-202;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Kikuchi, N., Generating optimal topologies in structural design using a homogenization method (1988) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 71 (2), pp. 197-224;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Sigmund, O., (2003) Topology optimization: theory, methods and applications.

Despite this, applications to realistic three-dimensional engineering problems are still limited. This study provides the instruments for the definition of a versatile and integrated framework in order to apply topology optimization to large-scale 3-D domains for the design of efficient and high-performing structures. The paper proposes a novel topology optimization strategy to identify the optimal layout of lateral resisting systems for tall buildings through the adoption of Mindlin–Reissner shell elements for the discretization of the continuum design domain. The framework is based on the practical interoperability between MATLAB, Ansys, and computer-aided design (CAD) environments to incorporate optimization routines in the conceptual design phase of structural systems. Finally, the paper examines a three-dimensional tall building case study in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed procedure to realistic Civil Engineering design problems and its robustness in finding optimal layouts free from mesh-dependency instabilities. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. {Keywords} 3-D optimization;

This paper presents a new approach based on building information modeling (BIM) and two-stage genetic algorithms (GA) to automatically optimize the clash-free steel reinforcement design. The approach considers reinforcement overlaps and congestion in beam-column joints and extracts 3D spatial information from design BIM models to underpin the automated clash-free optimization. The beam-column intersections are classified into appropriate categories such as T and cross joints, following by the generation of a clash-free reinforcement layout using the first-stage GA. Given the clash-free layout, the second-stage optimization is conducted using a hybrid GA and Hooke & Jeeves algorithm to calculate the optimal diameter combination of steel reinforcements (with minimum provided steel reinforcement area). An example is provided to illustrate the proposed BIM and two-stage GA based optimization method. © 2021 {Keywords} Architectural design; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Building optimization; Clash resolution; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Information theory; New approaches; Optimisations; RC frame structures; RC structure; Reinforcement; Reinforcement design; Steel reinforcement design; Steel reinforcements; Structural design {Notes} <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Gan, V.J.L.; Department of Building, Singapore; email: vincent.gan@nus.edu.sg</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Ahmadkhanlou, F., Adeli, H., Optimum cost design of reinforced concrete slabs using neural dynamics model (2005) Eng.

Currently, steel reinforcement design is performed manually or semi-automatically using computer software such as ETABS, with reference to building codes. These approaches are time consuming and sometimes error-prone. Recent advances in building information modeling (BIM) technology allow digital 3D BIM models to be leveraged for supporting different types of engineering analyses such as structural engineering design. With the aid of BIM technology, steel reinforcement design could be automated for fast, economical and error-free procedures. This paper presents a BIM-based framework using the developed three-stage hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) for automated optimization of steel reinforcement in RC frames. The methodology framework determines the selection and alignment of steel reinforcement bars in an RC building frame for the minimum steel reinforcement area, considering longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive and shear steel reinforcement. The first two stages optimize the longitudinal tensile and longitudinal compressive steel reinforcement while the third stage optimizes the shear steel reinforcement. International design code (BS8110) and buildability constraints are considered in the developed optimization framework. A BIM model in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is then automatically created to visualize the optimized steel reinforcement design results in 3D thereby facilitating design communication and generation of construction detailing drawings. A three-storey RC building frame is analyzed to check the applicability of the developed framework and its improvement over current design approaches. The results show that the developed methodology framework can minimize the steel reinforcement area quickly and accurately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Architectural design; Automated optimization; Automation; Building codes; Building Information Model - BIM; Building information modeling; Buildings; Codes (symbols); Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concrete reinforcements; Concretes; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Industry foundation classes; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Information theory; Metal drawing; Optimization; Optimization framework; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete design; Steel reinforcement; Steel reinforcement bars; Steel reinforcements; Structural optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :33</p>; <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Cheng, J.C.P.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong; email: cejcheng@ust.hk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Structural Use of Concrete.

After importing slab geometries from BIM, the proposed procedure utilised internal forces output from Finite Element Model (FEM) to map required reinforcement in two stages. In the first stage, the reinforcement specifications matched the spatial resolution of the FEM. In the second, the reinforcement was adjusted by imposing constructability functions to limit the number of arrangements in terms of zones and bar spacing. The aim of the paper was to investigate the parametric capabilities of the proposed approach in the context of an optimisation model for the generation of material-efficient structural designs. Numerical examples were presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the automated specification procedure. The material efficiency and the design complexity of the developed reinforcement configurations were also assessed against a conventional solution under realistic design conditions. © 2018 The Authors {Keywords} Architectural design; Automation; Building Information Modelling; Computational approach; Design; Efficiency; Floors; Material efficiency; Optimisation; Optimisation models; Optimisations; RC structure; RC structures; Reinforced concrete; Spatial resolution; Specifications; Steel reinforcement; Steel reinforcements; Structural design; Structural optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Eleftheriadis, S.14 Upper Woburn Place, United Kingdom; email: ucabele@ucl.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Coello, C., Christiansen, A., Santos Hernandez, F., A simple genetic algorithm for the design of reinforced concrete beams (1997) Eng.

The concept is based on a multi-objective optimization process that randomly generates an initial population of potential structural configurations which comply with architectural constraints, matching a set of general structural guidelines and seismic design rules. The initial population evolves through series of crossover between current solutions (parent) followed by mutations generating new solutions to be adopted, for the next iteration, when they improve the performance criteria. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to a widely used type of reinforced concrete (RC) wall-slab system for which general structural rules are first elaborated prior to the genetic algorithm implementation. The obtained results have demonstrated that, in the case of the considered architectural configurations, the proposed approach is very efficient in generating optimal structures, which are consistent with the predefined criteria and fulfilling the structural design requirements. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Algorithm implementation; Architectural constraints; Architectural design; BIM; Building design; Generative design; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Innovative approaches; Intelligent structural design; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal structures; Performance criterion; RC wall building design; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Structural configurations; Structural optimization; Walls (structural partitions) {Notes} <p>Cited By :11</p>; <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Bourahla, N.; Ecole Nationale Polytechnique (ENP), Algeria; email: nouredine.bourahla@g.enp.edu.dz</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Sun, C., Jiang, S., Skibniewski, M.J., Man, Q., Shen, L., A literature review of the factors limiting the application of BIM in the construction industry (2017) Technol.

Trim loss of rebar can be minimized with the use of discrete bars. To achieve this goal, a model to analyze reinforced concrete structure with one-dimensional (1D) cutting waste-optimization technique, integrated with BIM, is proposed. Building information modeling is selected as the hub in communicating project information among diverse design teams. This process permits project teams to utilize BIM models to simulate architectural and structural design requirements, and compare results speedily to make necessary changes in the designs to minimize rebar waste. The BIM rebar optimization analysis approach also supports cost-effective decision making during the design process. The proposed approach was validated with a two-story reinforced concrete structure, and the results indicated a high potential for budgetary savings. The proposed approach is also applicable for complex reinforced concrete construction projects, with repeated structural elements, and cost saving increases with the increase in the diameter of rebar. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers. {Keywords} Architectural design; Bim models; Budget control; Building information modeling; Communication; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost saving; Decision making; Design process; Design requirements; Design team; Emerging tools; High potential; Information theory; Material management; Model structures; Optimization; Optimization analysis; Project informations; Project stakeholders; Project team; Rebar; Reinforced concrete; Structural design; Structural elements; Structural reinforcement; Trim loss; Waste management; Waste rates {Notes} <p>Cited By :66</p>; <p>CODEN: JCEMD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Hewage, K.N.; School of Engineering, , BC, Canada; email: Kasun.Hewage@ubc.ca</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Bangash, M.Y.H., (2003) Structural Detailing in Concrete, , 2nd Ed., Thomas Telford Publishing, London; <br/>Begum, R.A., Siwar, C., Pereira, J.J., Jaafar, A.H., A benefit-cost analysis on the economic feasibility of construction waste minimisation: The case of Malaysia (2006) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 48 (1), pp. 86-98. , DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.01.004, PII S0921344906000139;<br/>(2011) A Council of the National Institute of Building Sciences, , www.buildingsmartalliance.org, Jan. 2011;<br/>(2011) Canada Border Service Agency, , www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsiyi-e/adl225/ad1225p-eng.html, Mar. 12, 2011;<br/>National round table on the environment and the economy (1992) A Rep. on Waste Management for the Construction Industry, , Canadian Construction Association CCA, Ottawa;<br/>Billet-steel bars for concrete reinforcement (2000) CAN/CSA G30, pp. 18-M92. , Canadian Standards Association CSA/National Standard of Canada, Toronto;<br/>Concrete materials and methods of concrete construction (2000) CSA A23.1, , Canadian Standards Association CSA/National Standard of Canada, Toronto;<br/>Chen, C.-L.S., Hart, S.M., Tham, W.M., A simulated annealing heuristic one-dimensional cutting stock problem (2005) Eur.

The first method, the design response grammar, uses design rules—configurable by parameters—to develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the structural system under development. The second method, design via optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization) and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation, which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density distribution of each individual structural component, which can be regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case study, the study shows that—after optimization—the fronts remain the same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the generalization that is established in the first case study by using the found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the computational cost. As such it is concluded that the design response grammar is a promising support tool for the exploration and structural assessment of conceptual building spatial designs. Future research should focus on more types of structural elements; more objectives; new constraints to ensure feasible solutions, especially stress constraints; and the application of state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning to find more generalizations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Approximation algorithms; Architectural design; Automated design; Building spatial design; Computational costs; Conceptual design; Design grammar; Design optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-disciplinary design; Optimization approach; Pareto principle; Preliminary assessment; Shape optimization; State-of-the-art techniques; Strain energy; Structural assessments; Structural component; Structural design; Structural elements; Structural optimization; Structural topology optimization; Topology {Notes} <p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Boonstra, S.; Eindhoven University of TechnologyNetherlands; email: s.boonstra@tue.nl</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Andreassen, E., Clausen, A., Schevenels, M., Lazarov, B.S., Sigmund, O., Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code (2011) Struct.

In this work, we discuss the importance of a close collaboration between these disciplines, and offer an alternative approach to generate new, integrated design ideas by means of a tailored structural topology optimization framework, which can potentially be of benefit to both the architectural and structural engineering communities. Several practical case studies, from actual collaborative design projects, are given to illustrate the successes and limitations of such techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. {Keywords} architectural design; Architecture; Architecture and engineering; Collaborative design; Computer aided engineering; construction industry; Construction industry; Engineering community; Geometrical patterns; High rise building; High-rise buildings; Layout optimization; manufacturing; Manufacturing constraint; Manufacturing constraints; multistorey building; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural topology optimization; Tall buildings; topology; Topology optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :100</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Paulino, G.H.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 205 N.

The operation of a building accounts for a large portion of its total CO2 emissions. Most efforts are focused on improving the energy efficiency related to the operation of a building. The relative importance of the energy and CO2 emissions from the construction materials increases with the increasing number of low-energy buildings. To minimize the life-cycle energy use of a building, the energy consumed from both materials in the construction phase as well as the energy consumed from the operation of the building must be reduced. In this study, an optimal design method for composite columns in high-rise buildings using a genetic algorithm is proposed to reduce cost and CO2 emissions from the structural materials in the construction phase. The proposed optimal method minimizes the total cost, including the additional cost calculated based on CO2 emissions from composite columns, while satisfying the structural design criteria and constructability conditions. The proposed optimal method is applied to an actual 35-story building, and the effective use of structural materials for the sustainable design of composite columns is investigated. It is shown that using more concrete thansteel section and using high-strength materials are economically and environmentally effective methods. © 2013 by the authors. {Keywords} Architectural design; Building materials; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Columns (structural); Composite column; Composite columns; Composite structures; Concrete construction; Concretes; Construction; Construction industry; Cost; Costs; Design of composites; Embodied energy; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; High performance concrete; High-strength materials; Life cycle; Life cycle energies; Low energy buildings; Optimal design methods; Optimization; Reinforced concrete; Steel reinforced concrete columns; Structural design; Sustainable development; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :50</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Choi, S.W.; Center for Structural Health Care Technology in Buildings, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-749, South Korea; email: watercloud@yonsei.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: T'Serclaes, P., Financing Energy Efficient Homes: Existing Policy Responses to Financial Barriers (2007), International Energy Agency: Paris, France; Guggemos, A.A., Horvath, A., Comparison of environmental effects of steel- and concrete-framed buildings Financing Energy Efficient Homes: Existing Policy Responses to Financial Barriers (2008) J.

In order to determine optimal design parameters of triple friction pendulum bearings for high-rise buildings, equations of motion for an isolated high-rise building are derived, and an evaluation function is developed to indicate the isolation effect with different pendulum parameters. In the optimization analysis, seven ground motions are scaled to three levels (corresponding to the service level, the design basis, and the maximum considered earthquakes, respectively) and the genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal pendulum parameters. The optimization results are compared with those obtained by the single-degree-of-freedom model, where significant difference is observed, showing the necessity of the presented study. Using the optimal parameters of triple friction pendulum bearings, seismic responses of the isolated building are analyzed and compared with those of the building isolated using the single friction pendulum bearings and the base-fixed building, where it is observed that the triple friction pendulum bearing is more effective and reliable in reducing base shear, floor acceleration, and story drifts. © The Author(s) 2019. {Keywords} Architectural design; base isolation; Base isolation; Base-isolated high-rise buildings; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Equations of motion; Friction; Friction pendulum bearings; Genetic algorithms; High rise building; high-rise building; Maximum considered earthquakes; Non linear; non-linear time-history analysis; optimization; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Pendulums; Seismology; Single degree of freedom models; Structural design; Tall buildings; triple friction pendulum bearing; Variable stiffness and damping {Notes} <p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>CODEN: ASEDD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Guo, T.; School of Civil Engineering, China; email: guotong@seu.edu.cn</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Amiri, G.G., Shakouri, A., Veismoradi, S., Effect of seismic pounding on buildings isolated by triple friction pendulum bearing (2017) Earthquakes and Structures, 12 (1), pp. 35-45; <br/>Ariga, T., Kanno, Y., Takewaki, I., Resonant behavior of base-isolated high-rise buildings under long-period ground motions (2006) The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings, 15 (3), pp. 325-338;<br/>Becker, T.C., Mahin, S.A., Experimental and analytical study of the bi-directional behavior of the triple friction pendulum isolator (2012) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 41 (3), pp. 355-373;<br/>Calugaru, V., Panagiotou, M., Seismic response of 20-story base-isolated and fixed-base reinforced concrete structural wall buildings at a near-fault site (2014) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 43 (6), pp. 927-948;<br/>Cheng, Z., Seismic isolation structure design: Tangshan Xinhua cultural plaza (2016) Architecture Technique, 10, pp. 111-115. , (in Chinese;<br/>Constantinou, M.C., Mokha, A.S., Reinhorn, A.M., Teflon bearings in base isolation II: modeling (1990) Journal of Structural Engineering, 116 (2), pp. 455-474;<br/>Dao, N.D., (2012) Seismic response of a full-scale 5-story steel frame building isolated by triple pendulum bearings under 3D excitations, , University of Nevada, Reno, NV, Doctoral Dissertation;<br/>Delgado, I., Aguiar, R., Caiza, P., Bilinear model proposal for seismic analysis using triple friction pendulum (TFP) Bearings (2017) Open Journal of Civil Engineering, 7 (1), pp. 14-31;<br/>Dhankot, M.A., Soni, D.P., Seismic response of triple friction pendulum bearing under multi hazard level excitations (2016) International Journal of Structural Engineering, 7 (4), pp. 412-431;<br/>Dhankot, M.A., Soni, D.P., Behaviour of triple friction pendulum isolator under forward directivity and fling step effect (2017) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 21 (3), pp. 872-881;<br/>Dolce, M., Cardone, D., Ponzo, F.C., Shaking-table tests on reinforced concrete frames with different isolation systems (2010) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 36 (5), pp. 573-596;<br/>El-Bayoumi, K., Naguib, M., Salem, F.A., Dynamic analysis of high rise seismically isolated buildings (2015) American Journal of Civil Engineering, 3 (2), pp. 43-50;<br/>Fenz, D.M., Constantinou, M.C., (2008) Development, implementation and verification of dynamic analysis models for multi-spherical sliding bearings, , New York, University at Buffalo, (, a), Technical report no.

The novelty of the procedure includes three aspects. Firstly, the modal acceleration responses of buildings are employed to evaluate the occupant comfort in the building instead of the commonly used total acceleration responses. This enhances the applicability of the proposed method and reduces the computation error by including the effect of the reoccurrence period of wind and avoiding calculation of the peak factor of response. Secondly, because the current method such as the modified Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler (HLRF) algorithm is not suitable to the optimization design considering multiple wind directions, to overcome this problem, the design point method in generalized random space (DPG method) is used to establish equations of reliability for converting modal acceleration constraints to natural frequency constraints, in which an approach of mapping transformation is used to treat the non-normal variables. Thirdly, by improving the method of determining the limit of the wind speed based on the joint distribution of the wind speed and direction, the failure probabilities of modal accelerations under all wind directions are combined based on the joint probability distribution of the wind speed and direction to obtain the limit of natural frequency constraints. The parameters of the joint probability distribution are determined from the meteorological observation data of the wind speed. In association with the Optimality Criterion (OC) algorithm, the proposed method is applied in the wind resistant optimization of a 60-stories standard model of Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC). The investigations show that the proposed method can effectively decrease the structural total weight subject to reliability frequency constraints, displacement constraints and inter-story drift constrains. Considering the randomness of parameters and joint distribution of the wind speed and direction in the comfort constraint could enhance the design space for the structural total weight. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} algorithm; Approach of mapping transform; Architectural design; Buildings; Conformal mapping; design; Design; Design point method; Design points; High rise building; High-rise building; Joint distribution of wind speed and direction; mapping; Mapping; Mapping transform; multistorey building; Natural frequencies; Occupant comfort reliability; Occupant comforts; optimization; Optimization; probability; Probability; Probability distributions; Reliability; Speed; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind; wind direction; Wind resistant optimization; Wind speed and directions; wind velocity {Notes} <p>Cited By :16</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Huang, Y.; Centre for Engineering Structure Disaster Prevention and Control, China; email: yqhuang@gzhu.edu.cn</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Hong, X., Gu, M., Comparison between wind and earthquake loadings on tall buildings in Shanghai in accordance with building structure codes (2005) J Tongji U (Nat Sci), 33, pp. 1291-1296. , [in Chinese]; <br/>Li, Q., Zou, X., Wu, J., Wang, Q., Integrated wind-induced response analysis and design optimization of tall steel buildings using Micro-GA (2011) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 20, pp. 951-971;<br/>Petrini, F., Ciampoli, M., Performance-based wind design of tall buildings (2012) Struct Infrastruct Eng, 8, pp. 954-966;<br/>Chan, C., An optimality criteria algorithm for tall steel building design using commercial standard sections (1992) Struct Optim, 5, pp. 26-29;<br/>Chan, C., Grierson, D., Sherbourne, A., Automatic optimal design of tall steel building frameworks (1995) J Struct Eng, 121, pp. 838-847;<br/>Chan, C., Optimal lateral stiffness design of tall buildings of mixed steel and concrete construction (2001) Struct Des Tall Build, 10, pp. 155-177;<br/>Chan, C., Chui, J., Wind-induced response and serviceability design optimization of tall steel buildings (2006) Eng Struct, 28, pp. 503-513;<br/>Chan, C., Wong, K., Structural topology and element sizing design optimisation of tall steel frameworks using a hybrid OC-GA method (2008) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 35, pp. 473-488;<br/>Chan, C., Huang, M., Kwok, K., Stiffness optimization for wind-induced dynamic serviceability design of tall buildings (2009) J Struct Eng, 135, pp. 985-997;<br/>Chan, C., Chui, J., Huang, M., Integrated aerodynamic load determination and stiffness design optimization of tall buildings (2009) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 18, pp. 59-80;<br/>Chan, C., Huang, M., Kwok, K., Integrated wind load analysis and stiffness optimization of tall buildings with 3D modes (2010) Eng Struct, 32, pp. 1252-1261;<br/>Huang, M., Tse, K., Chan, C., Kwok, K., Hitchcock, P., Lou, W., An integrated design technique of advanced linear-mode-shape method and serviceability drift optimization for tall buildings with lateral-torsional modes (2010) Eng Struct, 32, pp. 2146-2156;<br/>Huang, M., Chan, C., Kwok, K., Occupant comfort evaluation and wind-induced serviceability design optimization of tall buildings (2011) Wind Struct, 14, pp. 559-582;<br/>Huang, M., Tse, K., Chan, C., Lou, W., Integrated structural optimization and vibration control for improving wind-induced dynamic performance of tall buildings (2011) Int J Struct Stab Dyn, 11, pp. 1139-1161;<br/>Huang, M., Chan, C., Lou, W., Optimal performance-based design of wind sensitive tall buildings considering uncertainties (2012) Comput Struct, 98, pp. 7-16;<br/>Huang, M., Li, Q., Chan, C., Lou, W., Kwok, K., Li, G., Performance-based design optimal of tall concrete framed structures subject to wind excitations (2015) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 139, pp. 70-81;<br/>Hasofer, A., Lind, N., Exact and invariant second-moment code format (1974) J Eng Mech Div, 100, pp. 111-121;<br/>Rackwitz, R., Fiessler, B., Structural reliability under combined random load sequences (1978) Comput Struct, 9, pp. 489-494;<br/>Liu, P., Kiureghian, A., Optimization algorithms for structural reliability (1991) Struct Saf, 9, pp. 161-177;<br/>GB, 9-2012.

However, more research is required to understand the effects of these techniques on design processes and outcomes at the building scale, when substantial building performance simulations are considered. This paper presents a design study involving 34 participants who engaged with live feedback from surrogate models of structural and energy performance, while producing conceptual building geometries in several digital design environments. This study reveals that performance-enabled environments tend to improve simulated design objectives, while designers often prefer more flexibility than traditional automated optimization approaches when given the choice. Together, these preliminary findings encourage further development of interactive approaches to multi-objective early building design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} architectural design; Architectural design; Automated optimization; Building performance simulations; computer supported design; Conceptual building designs; Design objectives; Design performance; design tools; Energy performance; Interactive approach; interactive optimization; Interactive optimization; Structural design; sustainable design {Notes} <p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>CODEN: DSSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Brown, N.C.; Department of Architectural Engineering, United States; email: ncb5048@psu.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Acroterion, Photo of the national portrait gallery courtyard (2012), wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Portrait_Gallery_courtyard_DC1.jpg, Retrieved from commons; Arnaud, V.B., Quantifying architects' and engineers' use of structural design software (2013), Massachusetts Institute of Technology M.Eng.

In order to ensure an objective comparison of these two design approaches, the assessed building designs are obtained by a structural optimization procedure. Thus, any bias that would result from a particular designer's capabilities, experience, and subjectivity is avoided. Hence, a discrete Evolution Strategies optimization algorithm is employed to minimize the total cost of materials (steel and concrete) used in a structure subject to constraints associated with: (a) Eurocode 4 provisions for safety of composite column-members, (b) Eurocode 3 provisions for safety of structural steel members, and (c) seismic system behaviour and resistance. Extensive assessments and comparisons are performed for a variety of seismic intensities, for a number of building heights and plan configurations, etc. Results obtained by conducting 154 structural design optimization runs provide insight into potential advantages attained by partially substituting steel (as a main structural material) with concrete when designing the columns of earthquake-resistant buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Codes (standards); Composite structure; Composite structures; Concretes; Cost effectiveness; Earthquake-resistant buildings; Earthquakes; Eurocode 3; Eurocode 4; Eurocodes; Fundamental period; Push-over analysis; Pushover analysis; Seismic design; Shape optimization; Steel structure; Steel structures; Steel-concrete composite; Structural design optimization; Structural optimization; Structural steel members {Notes} <p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Papavasileiou, G.S.; School of Construction and the Built Environment, 1 Inverness Campus, United Kingdom; email: Georgios.Papavasileiou.ic@uhi.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Liu, M., Burns, S.A., Wen, Y.K., Optimal seismic design of steel frame buildings based on life cycle cost considerations (2003) Earthq.

This study presents building corner aerodynamic optimization procedure (AOP) to reduce the wind load, by coupling an optimization algorithm, large eddy simulation (LES) and an artificial neural network (ANN) based surrogate model. As an illustration, corner mitigation that has limited effect on both the structural and the architectural design is presented. Two aerodynamic optimization examples focusing on drag and lift minimization that consider wind directionality and turbulence are presented. For example, reductions in the order of more than 30% both in along- and across-wind responses are obtained through a two-surface chamfering that was constrained to 20% of the building width.

Due to their high energy consumption and material use, tall buildings have drawn particular attention with respect to their environmental impact. The influence of structural systems on the environmental performance of tall buildings is studied in this work, through calculating the embodied energy and CO 2 emissions of construction materials. In this direction, characteristic structural systems of tall buildings are considered in order to compare their environmental behaviour and account for their differences on the amount of construction materials used for their formation. In order to achieve this comparison, the structural systems are material-cost optimized using an optimization computing platform (OCP) developed by the authors for solving real-world structural design optimization problems. The results of this research provide valuable findings for the significant role of structural optimization in sustainable design of tall buildings as well as in limiting the use of construction materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Building materials; Computing platform; Construction; Design optimization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental assessment; Environmental management; Environmental performance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; High energy consumption; Life cycle; Life cycle assessment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural design optimization; Structural optimization; Structural systems; Sustainable development; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :15</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Lagaros, N.D.; Institute of Structural Analysis & Antiseismic Research, 9, Heroon Polytechniou Str., Zografou Campus, Greece; email: nlagaros@central.ntua.gr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2013), p. 70. , IEA, Modernising Building Energy Codes to secure our Global Energy Future: Policy Pathway; California Integrated Waste Management Board, (2000) Designing With Vision: A Technical Manual for Material Choices in Sustainable Construction, p. 42; <br/>Elnimeiri, M., Gupta, P., Sustainable structure of tall buildings (2008) Struct.

Therefore, a holistic approach for energy-efficient design over the life cycle of buildings is necessary. In this work, the relationships between structural efficiency, energetic performance, and aesthetic design are explored in the context of tall buildings. The goal is to reduce the structural mass in order to reduce embodied energy while considering operational energy as well as the aesthetic expression of the structure. For this, we propose a framework that integrates code-based structural design of tall buildings with energy demand simulations, and perform a multiobjective optimization for a tall building in various climate zones. We show that structure can act as shading, that is, cooling savings are achieved with respect to a fully glazed building. Further, we illustrate the trade-offs between buildings with reduced mass, with comparatively little cooling savings, and heavier buildings, with increased cooling savings potential, for example, up to 50%. Finally, we discuss the impact of the column design in different climate zones. The resulting trade-offs allow the architect to make an informed decision between structural design and energy efficiency of the building without sacrificing the architectural intent. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. {Keywords} Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Architectural design; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy performance; Energy-efficient design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Holistic approach; Informed decision; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Operational energy; Savings potential; Structural analysis; Structural design; Structural efficiencies; Structural optimization; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>CODEN: JAEIE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Felkner, J.; School of Architecture, United States; email: juliana.felkner@austin.utexas.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Adeli, H., Cheng, N.-T., Augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm for structural optimization (1994) J.

This study proposes an optimal design method for minimizing the volume of the primary structural members (core wall, outrigger, and external columns) and calculating the optimal locations of outriggers using a genetic algorithm with the goal of efficiently controlling the lateral displacement of a high-rise building. The optimal solution of the outrigger system was determined based on the change in the number of stories (from one to four) at which outriggers were installed in a prototype model (a 400-m high-rise building). The results indicate that increasing the number of outrigger installations reduces the total volume of structural members needed in the outrigger system to satisfy the displacement constraint of the top floor (H/500, H: building height). Additionally, the cross-sections of the core wall and outrigger decreased and that of the external column increased, which indicated that the role of the external column in the control of lateral displacements increased as the number of outrigger installations increased. As a result, the contribution of the core wall to the bending moment decreased, which reduced the cross-section of the core wall. These results provide an optimal solution that considers the ideal locations of the outriggers and minimizes the volume of structural members within the maximum lateral displacement range, which is specified as a structural performance constraint. Therefore, this study can provide designers with a well-defined target performance level (e.g., lateral displacement or bending stress) during the initial stage of the outrigger system design process and an economical design that minimizes cost. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. {Keywords} Algorithms; Architectural design; building; Buildings; design; Design; displacement; Displacement constraint; genetic

This also stands for the design of supplemental dissipation devices such as multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs). Although MTMDs present several advantages over conventional TMDs, their design is a rather complex process. Thus, an efficient optimization algorithm is necessary to design large-scale MTMDs. This paper presents a powerful multi-hazard optimization-based methodology for the design of MTMDs attached to tall buildings. The total added mass is minimized, while the multi-hazard life-cycle cost (LCC) is taken as a constraint. To enable an efficient optimization of large-scale MTMDs, a gradient-based algorithm is developed, supported by a sensitivity analysis of the PEER-based multi-hazard LCC formulation. Material interpolation techniques are used to provide distinct design alternatives. The methodology is applied to a realistic tall building. First, a small-scale problem is used to compare the new methodology with classic evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework required less than 2% of the function evaluations executed by the benchmark algorithms to deliver competitive solutions. Subsequently, large-scale problems using different formulations are presented. Solving problems with 133 TMDs, the optimized solutions allow to reduce the multi-hazard LCC by 35%, adding 0.69–0.86% of the building mass. The results show that the algorithm can provide economic designs at acceptable computational costs, and the methodology can capture consistently the multi-hazard behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Costs; Design alternatives; Evolutionary algorithms; Gradient based algorithm; Hazards; Interpolation techniques; Life cycle; Life cycle costs (LCC); Life-cycle cost optimization; Multi hazard approach; Multi-hazard optimization; Multiple tuned mass dampers; Optimization algorithms; Optimized solutions; Seismic design; Sensitivity analysis; Structural design; Tall buildings; Tuned mass dampers; Wind design {Notes} <p>CODEN: CMSTC</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Lavan, O.; Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Israel; email: lavan@technion.ac.il</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Aly, A.M., Abburu, S., On the design of high-rise buildings for multihazard: fundamental differences between wind and earthquake demand (2015) Shock Vib, , 148681; <br/>Zhou, X., Xu, Y., Multi-hazard performance assessment of a transfer-plate high-rise building (2007) Earthq Eng Eng Vib, 6 (4), pp. 371-382;<br/>Li, Y., Ellingwood, B.R., Framework for multihazard risk assessment and mitigation for wood-frame residential construction (2009) J Struct Eng, 135 (2), pp. 159-168;<br/>Li, Y., van de Lindt, J.W., Loss-based formulation for multiple hazards with application to residential buildings (2012) Eng Struct, 38, pp. 123-133;<br/>Mahmoud, H., Cheng, G., Framework for lifecycle cost assessment of steel buildings under seismic and wind hazards (2017) J Struct Eng, 143 (3), p. 04016186;<br/>Chapain, S., Aly, A.M., Vibration attenuation in high-rise buildings to achieve system-level performance under multiple hazards (2019) Eng Struct, 197, p. 109352;<br/>Elias, S., Rupakhety, R., Olafsson, S., Analysis of a benchmark building installed with tuned mass dampers under wind and earthquake loads (2019) Shock Vib, 2019. , 7091819;<br/>Venanzi, I., Lavan, O., Ierimonti, L., Fabrizi, S., Multi-hazard loss analysis of tall buildings under wind and seismic loads (2018) Struct Infrastruct Eng, 14 (10), pp. 1295-1311;<br/>Den Hartog, J., Mechanical Vibrations (1947), McGraw-Hill New York, NY; Wirsching, P.H., Campbell, G.W., Minimal structural response under random excitation using the vibration absorber (1973) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 2 (4), pp. 303-312;<br/>Warburton, G., Optimum absorber parameters for various combinations of response and excitation parameters (1982) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 10 (3), pp. 381-401;<br/>Tsai, H.C., Lin, G.C., Optimum tuned-mass dampers for minimizing steady-state response of support-excited and damped systems (1993) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 22 (11), pp. 957-973;<br/>Tsai, H.C., Lin, G.C., Explicit formulae for optimum absorber parameters for force-excited and viscously damped systems (1994) J Sound Vib, 176 (5), pp. 585-596;<br/>Bakre, S., Jangid, R., Optimum parameters of tuned mass damper for damped main system (2007) Struct Control Health Monit, 14 (3), pp. 448-470;<br/>Xu, Y., Kwok, K., Samali, B., Control of wind-induced tall building vibration by tuned mass dampers (1992) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 40 (1), pp. 1-32;<br/>Kwok, K., Samali, B., Performance of tuned mass dampers under wind loads (1995) Eng Struct, 17 (9), pp. 655-667;<br/>Aly, A.M., Proposed robust tuned mass damper for response mitigation in buildings exposed to multidirectional wind (2014) Struct Des Tall Spec, 23 (9), pp. 664-691;<br/>Marano, G.C., Sgobba, S., Greco, R., Mezzina, M., Robust optimum design of tuned mass dampers devices in random vibrations mitigation (2008) J Sound Vib, 313 (3-5), pp. 472-492;<br/>Marano, G.C., Greco, R., Sgobba, S., A comparison between different robust optimum design approaches: application to tuned mass dampers (2010) Probab Eng Mech, 25 (1), pp. 108-118;<br/>Constantinou, M.C., Soong, T.T., Dargush, G.F., (1998), Passive energy dissipation systems for structural design and retrofit.

This context presents a clear opportunity to integrate advanced functionality for engaging with quantitative design objectives directly into computational design environments. This paper presents a toolbox for data-driven design, which draws from data science and optimization methods to enable customized workflows for early design space exploration. It then applies these approaches to a multi-objective conceptual design problem involving structural and energy performance for a long span roof with complex geometry and considerable design freedom. The case study moves from initial brainstorming through design refinement while demonstrating the advantages of flexible workflows for managing design data. Through investigation of a realistic early design prompt, this paper reveals strengths, limitations, potential pitfalls, and future opportunities for data-driven parametric design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Architectural design; Architecture and engineering; Complex geometries; Computational design; Conceptual design; Data Science; Data-driven design; Design space exploration; Energy simulation; Interactive optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Optimization method; Parametric buildings; Performance simulation; Quantitative design; Roof coverings; Structural design; Surrogate modeling; Sustainable design {Notes} <p>Cited By :14</p>; <p>CODEN: AUCOE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Brown, N.C.; Department of Architectural Engineering, 104 Engineering Unit A, University Park, United States; email: ncb5048@psu.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Caldas, L.G., Norford, L.K., A design optimization tool based on a genetic algorithm (2002) Autom.

This analysis model is applied to reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings, which comprise two heterogeneous materials—concrete and steel—that have different environmental impacts and thus have a high potential for CO2 emission mitigation. In the PBODS method presented in this study, CO2 emissions, material production costs, and the coefficient of variation (COV) of the inter-story drift ratio, which reflects the seismic performance, are set as the objective functions, and optimal designs that can minimize these three objective functions. The optimal designs for a 4-story and a 10-story RC buildings are then evaluated with respect to environmental sustainability, economic feasibility, and seismic performance using the presented integrated analysis model. Furthermore, the proposed model is used to quantitatively investigate the variations in CO2 emissions and material production costs depending on variations in the performance objectives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; CO2 emissions; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Earthquake engineering; Ecodesign; Economic analysis; Embodied CO2 emissions; Environmental impact; Environmental sustainability; Inter-story drift ratios; Life cycle; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Optimal structural design; Optimal structural designs; Optimal systems; Performance based; Performance Based Seismic Engineering; Performance-based green seismic design; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural design; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Sustainable structural design {Notes} <p>Cited By :14</p>; <p>CODEN: ENEBD</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Oh, B.K.; Yonsei University, Center for Structural Health Care Technology in Building, South Korea; email: aeioobk@yonsei.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Pachauri, R.K., Reisinger, A., Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007), IPCC Geneva Switzerland; De T'serclaes, P., Financing Energy Efficient Homes: Existing Policy Responses to Financial Barriers (2007), International Energy Agency France; Guggemos, A.A., Horvath, A., Comparison of environmental effects of steel- and concrete-framed buildings (2005) J.

The developed framework consists of a series of methods that enable the production of a complex 3D structures composed of a set of flat 2D panels whose mechanical properties are locally tuned by varying the shape of embedded spiraling patterns. The resulting panels perform as variable stiffness elements, and they are optimized to match a desired target shape once assembled together. The presented framework includes all the steps for the physical delivery of architectural objects, including conception, static assessment, and digital fabrication. The developed framework has been applied to an architectural scale prototype, which demonstrates the potential of integrating architectural design, computational simulation, structural engineering, and digital fabrication, opening up several possible novel applications in the building sector. © 2021 Institution of Structural Engineers {Keywords} Advanced manufacturing; Architecture; Bending-active structures; Computational design; Digital fabrication; Form-finding; Mesostructured; Optimization; Shell; Simulation; Structural design {Notes} <p>Correspondence Address: Laccone, F.; ISTI, via G.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the design of architectural floor plans by integrating structural layout analysis directly into the planning process. In order to achieve this, we introduce a planning tool which interactively enforces checks for structural stability of the current design, and which on demand proposes how to stabilize it if necessary. Technically, our solution contains an interactive architectural modelling framework as well as a constrained optimization module where both are based on respective architectural rules. Using our tool, an architect can predict already in a very early planning stage whose designs are structurally sound such that later changes due to stability reasons can be prevented. We compare manually computed solutions with optimal results of our proposed automated design process in order to show how much our proposed system can help architects to improve the process of laying out structural models optimally. © 2016 The Authors Computer Graphics Forum © 2016 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. {Keywords} architectural CAD; Architectural design;

However, most published case studies tend to reduce practical design and analysis problems into simplified theoretical models in which materiality, geometry and loading conditions are over-simplified. This paper presents a structural optimization case study that allows the inclusion of complexity using Grasshopper and Matlab. The optimization process includes an automated update of structural size, shape and topology, material properties, and loading conditions. The method is applied to a parametric skyscraper design problem to demonstrate the use of Grasshopper to expedite the implementation of a complex problem and thereby facilitate the architectural schematic design phase. © 2019 CAD Solutions, LLC. {Keywords} Architectural design; Complex problems; Design and analysis; Design problems; FEA; Finite element method; Form finding; Form-finding; GA; Gallium; Grasshopper; Loading condition; Office buildings; Schematic design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Structural size; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Wonoto, N.; Clemson UniversityUnited States; email: nwonoto@clemson.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/latest-release/, Dassault Systèmes; Adams, V., Askenazi, A., (1998) Building Better Products with Finite Element Analysis, , OnWord Press; <br/>Curletto, G., Parametric modeling in form-finding and application to the design of modular canopies (2014) Mobile and Rapidly Assembled Structures, 4;<br/>Felippa, C.A., A historical outline of matrix structural analysis: A play in three acts (2000) Computers and Structures;<br/>Felkner, J., Chatzi, E., Kotnik, T., Architectural feedback in the structural optimization process (2013) Structures and Architecture: Concepts, Applications, and Challenges;<br/>Friedrich, E., (2008) The Voronoi Diagram in Structural Optimization, , M.S.

A BIM-based optimisation approach that utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm with constructability constraints is established for that purpose. A multilevel engineering analysis model is developed to perform structural layout optimisation, slab and columns sizing optimisation, and slab and columns reinforcement optimisation. The overall approach is validated using real buildings and the relationships between cost and carbon optimum solutions are explored. The study exhibits how cost effective and carbon efficient solutions could be obtained without compromising the feasibility of the optimised designs. Results demonstrate that the structural layout and the slab thickness are amongst the most important design optimisation parameters. Finally, the overall analysis suggests that the building form can influence the relationships between cost and carbon for the different structural components. © 2018 The Authors {Keywords} Architectural design; BIM; Carbon; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Cost; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Early design decisions; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Engineering analysis models; FEM; Finite element method; Finite element modelling; Genetic algorithms; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Integrated design approaches; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Optimisation; Optimisations; RC structure; RC structures; Reinforced concrete; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :29</p>; <p>CODEN: ENEBD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Eleftheriadis, S.; University College London, 14 Upper Woburn Place, United Kingdom; email: efstathios.eleftheriadis.13@ucl.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Adamu, A., Karihaloo, B., Rozvany, G., Minimum cost design of reinforced concrete beams using continuum-type optimality criteria (1994) Struct.

The aim of these tools is to facilitate and control complex building geometries. Parametric design programs such as Grasshopper (GH) for Rhino or Generative Components popularized this approach by providing easy-to-use visual programming environments that integrate with computer-aided design (CAD) packages. A logical next step consists in connecting parametric designs to applications that evaluate non-geometric aspects such as building physics or structural performance. This brings about new opportunities of collaboration between architects and engineers in the early stages of building design. The ease of testing alternatives by tweaking a set of parameters also opens the door for the application of generic optimization algorithms. Karamba is a finite element program geared towards interactive use in the parametric design environment GH. Being a GH plug-in, it seamlessly integrates with the diverse habitat of other third party programs available for GH. These range from building physics applications to genetic optimization engines. In the author's company, Karamba is used in early-stage design, form-finding, and structural optimization. ""White Noise"", a mobile exhibition pavilion for the Salzburg Biennale, serves as a case study that shows how Karamba can be used to optimize the structural performance of intricate building geometries. {Keywords} Algorithms; Architectural design; Computer aided design; Computer programming; Finite element method; Finite element programs; Finite elements; Generic optimization algorithm; Geometry; Integrated planning; Integrated planning process; Inter active; Optimization; Parametric design; Parametric design environment; Parametric design tools; Shape optimization; Structural; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Visual programming environments; White noise {Notes} <p>Cited By :35</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Aish, R., (2005) Introduction to Generative Components, a Parametric and Associative Design System for Architecture, Building Engineering and Digital Fabrication, , http://www.bentley.com, White paper; <br/>McNeel, R., (2013) Grasshopper, , http://grass-hopper3d.com, website;<br/>Coenders, J., Approximating complex shapes with intelligent structures: Embedded design intelligence in systems for the early phases of design (2006) J.

This paper presents a technique for the wind-resistant optimal design of supertall buildings with a complex structural system including concrete-filled steel tube columns, shear walls, and various types of beams and columns. In each optimal design cycle, the dynamic wind load acting on a building is transformed into a set of multiple-oriented equivalent static wind loads, which converts the optimal design for a building acted by dynamic loads into a simpler optimal design problem that considers only static loads. The objective function and constraint functions are explicitly formulated for various types of frame and area members, and consequently, the optimal design problem is mathematically modeled. The optimality criteria method is employed to seek a solution to the optimal design problem. A 68-story actual supertall building with a height of 303 m is considered for a case study. The obtained results show that the presented technique is capable of giving a good numerical optimal solution for practical use. The technique and results obtained from this study are valuable for academic and professional engineers involved in wind engineering and structural design.

The plastic design layout optimization formulation is used, considering the multiple load cases arising from the requirements of a well-known structural design code. The superposition approach is shown to be applicable to the three primary load case problems involved. It is found that the optimal layouts identified differ from those obtained when bracing is sought for a pre-existing frame, already designed to resist gravity loads. A significant finding is that a parameter related to the difference in vertical and lateral loads to be applied in the applicable load cases is a key factor determining the optimal layout of frame members. Since applicable load cases are design code dependent, this also indicates that optimal layout will be strongly influenced by choice of design code. Simple benchmark problems and a practical building design example are used to illustrate the concepts explored. © 2019, The Author(s). {Keywords} Architectural design; Bench-mark problems; Building design; Building frames; Codes (symbols); Layout optimization; Multiple load case; Multiple load cases; Optimal layout; Optimal systems; Plastic designs; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural design codes; Topology optimization {Notes} <p>CODEN: SMOTB</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Gilbert, M.; Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Mappin Street, United Kingdom; email: m.gilbert@sheffield.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Brettle, M.E., Brown, D.G., (2009) Steel Building Design: Worked Examples for Students. the Steel Construction Institute; <br/>(2006) Eurocode 3: Design of Steel Structures.

The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used.

New components are typically generated using numerical models validated by experiments, and the general methodology mainly consists of extensive numerical parametric studies. Since the basic geometrical shape is chosen beforehand, it is not possible to know if an optimum is reached. In view of this, topology optimization has emerged as a new design technique which offers much more design freedom. In this work, topology optimization is used to simultaneously improve the mechanical and heat transfer characteristics of building components. The first study shows that using a density-based method intermediate densities can constitute part of the optimized solution and the choice of certain parameters in the interpolation functions becomes influential. The second study presents a multi-material topology optimization approach in which an additional predefined material is added to the optimization problem. The results of both studies are compared. Finally, a practical case is optimized using this multi-material, multi-physics approach, and an optimized brickwork support bracket is found. Results show that a combined structural and thermal topology optimization approach with multiple materials can provide interesting and innovative design solutions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. {Keywords} Architectural design; Building engineering; Computer aided engineering; Heat transfer; Interpolation; Interpolation schemes; Multi-material design; Multi-material designs; Shape optimization; SIMP; Structural design; Structural optimization; Thermal bridging; Thermal Engineering; Thermoanalysis; Topology; Topology optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>CODEN: SMOTB</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Vantyghem, G.; Department of Structural Engineering, Valentin Vaerwyckweg 1, 9000, Belgium; email: gieljan.vantyghem@ugent.be</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Allaire, G., A review of adjoint methods for sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification and optimization in numerical codes (2015) Ingénieurs de l’Automobile SIA, 836, pp. 33-36; <br/>Beghini, L.L., Beghini, A., Katz, N., Baker, W.F., Paulino, G.H., Connecting architecture and engineering through structural topology optimization (2014) Eng Struct, 59, pp. 716-772;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Kikuchi, N., Generating Optimal Topologies in Structural Design Using a Homogenization Method (1988) Comput Mothod Appl M, 71 (2), pp. 197-224;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Optimal shape design as a material distribution problem (1989) Struct Multidiscip O, 1 (4), pp. 193-202;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Sigmund, O., Material interpolation schemes in topology optimization (1999) Arch Appl Mech, 69 (9-10), pp. 635-654;<br/>Bendsøe, M.P., Lund, E., Olhoff, N., Sigmund, O., Topology optimization-broadening the areas of application (2005) Control Cybern, 34 (1), pp. 7-35;<br/>Bogomolny, M., Amir, O., Conceptual design of reinforced concrete structures using topology optimization with elastoplastic material modeling (2012) Int J Numer Meth Eng, 90 (13), pp. 1578-1597;<br/>Bruggi, M., Duysinx, P., Topology optimization for minimum weight with compliance and stress constraints (2012) Struct Multidiscip O, 46 (3), pp. 369-384;<br/>Bruggi, M., Taliercio, A., Design of masonry blocks with enhanced thermomechanical performances by topology optimization (2013) Constr Build Mater, 48, pp. 424-433;<br/>Eschenauer, H.A., Olhoff, N., Topology optimization of continuum structures: A review (2001) Appl Mech Rev, 54 (4), pp. 331-390;<br/>Guan, H., Chen, Y.J., Loo, Y.C., Xie, Y.M., Steven, G.P., Bridge topology optimisation with stress, displacement and frequency constraints (2003) Comput Struct, 81 (3), pp. 131-145;<br/>Guo, X., Cheng, G.D., Recent development in structural design and optimization (2010) Acta Mech Sinica, 26 (6), pp. 807-823;<br/>(2017) Introduction HK5 Brickwork Support System, , http://www.halfen.com/en/771/products/brickwork-support-systems/hk5-brickwork-support/introduction, Accessed 14 December 2017;<br/>Jansseune, A., De Corte, W., The influence of convoy loading on the optimized topology of railway bridges (2017) Struct Eng Mech, 64 (1), pp. 45-58;<br/>Park, P., Gilbert, M., Tyas, A., Larsen, O.P., Potential use of structural layout optimization at the conceptual design stage (2012) Int J Archit Comput, 10 (1), pp. 13-32;<br/>Sasaki, M., Ito, T., Isozaki, A., (2007) Morphogenesis of flux structure, , AA Publications, London;<br/>Sigmund, O., A 99 line topology optimization code written in Matlab (2001) Struct Multidiscip O, 21 (2), pp. 120-127;<br/>Stromberg, L.L., Beghini, A., Baker, W.F., Paulino, G.H., Topology optimization for braced frames: Combining continuum and beam/column elements (2012) Eng Struct, 37, pp. 106-124;<br/>Svanberg, K., The Method of Moving Asymptotes - a New Method for Structural Optimization (1987) Int J Numer Meth Eng, 24 (2), pp. 359-373;<br/>Vantyghem, G., Corte, W., Boel, V., Steeman, M., Structural and thermal performances of topological optimized masonry blocks (2016) Asian Congress of Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization 2016, , Nagasaki</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\7D5XVWGT\Vantyghem et al. - 2019 - Multi-material topology optimization involving sim.pdf","","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Computer aided engineering; Building engineering; Structural optimization; Interpolation; Heat transfer; Interpolation schemes; Multi-material design; Multi-material designs; SIMP; Thermal bridgi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the environmental impact, research on a green design model for super-tall buildings is necessary. This design model should minimize both CO 2 emissions and cost in the mega-column construction and design phases with consideration of the member or building size. In this regard, a multi-objective green design model (MOGDM) capable of minimizing construction cost and reducing CO 2 emissions is proposed in this study. The MOGDM is applied to the design of mega columns for a super-tall building and its performance is evaluated based on the average environmental impact reduction rate (AER) and the average increase-in-cost reduction rate (AICR); these indexes are developed to assess the CO 2 emission and construction cost reduction capability. Under the loading scenarios considered in this study, the average AER and AICR for the MOGDM output are 6.76% and 58.02%, respectively. Thus, the evaluation results confirm that the MOGDM proposed in this study can effectively reduce CO 2 emissions and cost in the design and construction phases of mega columns for super-tall buildings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} architectural design; Architectural design; Article; building; building construction; Building materials; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; CO2 emissions; column; Construction; Construction costs; construction material; Construction material cost; construction work; cost; cost analysis; Cost reduction; Design and construction; Design method; Ecodesign; Embodied CO 2 emissions; emission control; environmental impact; Environmental impact; Evaluation results; Green design method; High rise building; High-rise building; Mega column; Mega columns; multi objective green design model; priority journal; process optimization; Structural design; structural model; Super tall buildings; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :6</p>; <p>CODEN: STEVA</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Park, H.S.; Department of Architectural Engineering, South Korea; email: hspark@yonsei.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: ACI, 318-11 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (2011), American Concrete Institute Farmington Hills, MI; AISC, Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (2010), American Institute of Steel Construction Chicago, IL; Aldwaik, M., Adeli, H., Advances in optimization of highrise building structures (2014) Struct.

The optimal buildings are obtained through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) multi-objective technique. Unlike most of this type of studies, the complete design of the 3D frames will be obtained considering the slabs, beams, columns, and braces as variables of the algorithm that are used to calculate dead and seismic loads. For this aim, two objective functions are established: (1) the first objective function is the cost of the structural building that includes materials and construction; (2) the second is the ratio between the maximum inter-story drift and the allowable drift, which is the most common structural performance parameter used by the earthquake building codes. For the purpose of this study, several R/C buildings are designed in accordance with the Mexico City Building Code (MCBC) using NSGA-II. The results demonstrate that as the height of the R/C buildings tend to increase, the frames with BRBs are more economical having similar level of structural performance in comparison with traditional moment resisting R/C framed buildings. In addition, the application of the evolutionary technique based on genetic algorithms for structural design improves considerably the structural performance and is able to reduce the total structural cost of the buildings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. {Keywords} 3D reinforced concrete; Architectural design; Buckling restrained braces; Buckling-restrained braces; Building codes; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Evolutionary techniques; Genetic algorithms; Interstory drifts; Maximum inter-story drift; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Objective functions; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural buildings; Structural performance {Notes} <p>CODEN: SMOTB</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Bojórquez, E.; Facultad de Ingeniería, Calzada de las Américas y B.

Little, if any, research has been conducted regarding the design and construction of a floor system that successfully accounts for eco-friendliness. To remedy this, an optimal sustainable design model for composite beams (OSDMCB) has been developed. The proposed OSDMCB was used to analyse the relationship between CO2 emissions and costs required for the construction of concrete slabs supported by steel beams composed of four different materials: concrete, steel frame, rebar, and a shear connector. To verify the performance of the OSDMCB, it was applied to the design and construction of composite beams in a 30-story office building. When both costs and CO2 emissions are simultaneously minimised, the composite beam of the OSDMCB, compared with a composite beam without the OSDMCB, reduces the costs and CO2 emissions by 6.23% and 4.07%, respectively. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. {Keywords} Architectural design; Carbon dioxide; CO2 emissions; Composite beam; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Design and construction; Ecodesign; Floor systems; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimisation; Multiobjective optimization; office buildings; Office buildings; Shear connector; slab system; Slab systems; Steel beams and girders; Steel frame; Structural design; Sustainable development; sustainable structural design {Notes} <p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Park, H.S.; Department of Architectural Engineering, South Korea; email: hspark@yonsei.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2010), Specification for structural steel buildings, (ANSI/AISC 360-10).

The research is focused on addressing challenges related to the building industry at large, including most prominently the improvement of energy efficiency, onsite power generation, and the reduction of the quantity of materials required to build. We introduce four innovations in context of the design of an experimental building (NEST HiLo): a lightweight, unreinforced funicular floor system; a flexibly formed, concrete shell sandwich roof; a soft actuated, adaptive solar facade and an automated, occupant-centred control system. We demonstrate novel structural engineering approaches to compression-only concrete elements and shell design using multi-criteria shape optimisation. We explore a building facade concept, which employs robotic actuators for solar shading and on-site generation. In addition, the operational phase of the building will be used as a living laboratory where occupants’ locations and needs for comfort are detected and used for the control of the energy innovations. The research provides insight into design topics that will become increasingly relevant for the evolution of improved lifecycle energy buildings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Adaptive control systems; Adaptive solar facade; Architectural design; Building energy systems; Buildings; Concretes; Construction; Construction industry; Energy efficiency; Experimental buildings; Facades; Life cycle; Light-weight constructions; Lightweight construction; Living laboratories; Occupant-centred control; Operational phase; Robotic actuators; Shape optimisation; Shell structure; Shell structures; Structural design {Notes} <p>Cited By :23</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Block, P.; Block Research Group, Stefano-Franscini-Platz 1, Switzerland; email: block@arch.ethz.ch</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2013), UNEP, Buildings and Climate Change, UNEP DTIE Sustainable Consumption and Production Branch, 15 Rue de Milan, 75009 Paris, France; Sartori, I., Hestnes, A., Energy use in the life cycle of conventional and low-energy buildings: a review article (2007) Energy Build., 39 (3), pp. 249-257; <br/>Prez-Lombard, L., Ortiz, J., Pout, C., A review on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy Build., 40 (3), pp. 394-398;<br/>D'Agostino, D., Assessment of the progress towards the establishment of definitions of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs) in European Member States (2015) J.

Hence building structure design is a vital part in architecture design, architects often explore novel applications of their technologies for building structure innovation. However, such searches relied on experiences, expertise or gut feeling. In this paper, a new design method for the optimal building frame column design based on the genetic algorithm is proposed. First of all, in order to construct the optimal model of the building frame column, building units are divided into three categories in general: building bottom, main building and building roof. Secondly, the genetic algorithm is introduced to optimize the building frame column. In the meantime, a PGA-Skeleton based concurrent genetic algorithm design plan is proposed to improve the optimization efficiency of the genetic algorithm. Finally, effectiveness of the mentioned algorithm is verified through the simulation experiment.

From the initial design stage, a state space equation is developed including the dynamic characteristics of the both systems and multiple loading conditions. A simultaneous optimization problem is formulated by introducing a preference model and the genetic algorithm is employed in order to find the optimal distribution and capacities of the control devices.

To show the authenticity and robustness of the new algorithm in solving optimization problems, some benchmark test functions are tested, at first. Then, an eleven-story benchmark building equipped with 3 MR dampers is considered to get the optimum design of the MR damper using the hybrid CSS-GW.

A seven-storey full-scale structure previously tested on shaking table was used as a reference. The optimal design parameters of the TMDs, i.e. damping and frequency ratios, were determined by using a genetic algorithm on a simplified model of the reference structure, composed by seven masses each representing one storey. The optimal solutions for the TMDs were then applied to a detailed finite element model of the seven-storey building, where the timber panels were modelled with shell elements and the steel connectors with linear spring. By comparing the numerical results of the building with and without multiple TMDs, the improvement in seismic response was assessed. Dynamic time-history analyses were carried out for a set of seven natural records, selected in accordance with Eurocode 8, on the simplified model, and for Kobe earthquake ground motion on the detailed model. Results in terms of acceleration reduction for different TMD configurations show that the behaviour of the seven-storey timber building can be significantly improved, especially at the upper storeys.

While Life Cycle Assessment and many environmental approaches as well as low-carbon materials are key areas of sustainable designs, optimisation methods have not been fully developed and integrated in the design process to enhance a building's sustainability. Although there are studies attempting to mitigate buildings' carbon footprints, most of them examine the major components (slab and column systems) separately, making it hard for structural engineers to apply their findings in a real project. This paper intends to address this limitation by introducing an innovative design methodology for the carbon optimisation of reinforced concrete buildings. A detailed formulation of a flat plate building's optimisation is presented, and an advanced Branch-and-Reduce deterministic algorithm is adopted to solve for minimum CO2 emissions. Compared to genetic algorithm, the proposed approach achieves a further 31% reduction in the building's embodied emissions. In this research, multiple case studies are optimised and analysed with respect to varying slab spans and numbers of stories. Overall, the optimisation algorithm performs more efficiently in buildings that are subjected to greater compressive loads, and the optimal designs tend to reduce the slab-to-column area ratio to obtain the best sustainable outcomes. Compared to the conventional designs, the optimised ones achieve 5.3–17.7% reduction in the total carbon emissions. From a correlation analysis, the column concrete strength, column size, and building's height are found to be the most significant design variables. Although the structural weight is closely related to the total embodied carbon in optimised buildings, solutions with greater material savings are not necessarily more environmentally superior. It is the balancing act between the design constraints, ratio of concrete and reinforcement consumption, and ratio of concrete and steel carbon coefficients that determines the most eco-friendly design option. Given a complex relation between design variables, a thorough optimisation problem and methodology as presented in this paper are highly effective and recommended in sustainable designs of concrete buildings. The obtained findings from the numerical applications could effectively guide structural designers towards sustainable design solutions that have the best environmental performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} % reductions; Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Concrete buildings; Construction industry; Design variables; Deterministic algorithms; Ecodesign; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Emission control; Environmental management; Flat plate; Flat plate building; Genetic algorithms; Global environmental impacts; Life cycle; Low carbon; Optimisation; Optimisations; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete structure; Reinforced concrete structures; Structural design; Sustainable development {Notes} <p>CODEN: JCROE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Trinh, H.T.M.K.; School of Engineering and Built Environment, Australia; email: kim.trinh@griffithuni.edu.au</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Afzal, M., Liu, Y., Cheng, J.C.P., Gan, V.J.L., Reinforced concrete structural design optimization: a critical review (2020) J.

But in earthquake-prone areas, large-scale buildings mean higher risks; therefore improving the seismic capacity of buildings is an important measure to reduce the risk of buildings. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the isolation structure of buildings was introduced briefly, and the cost-benefit based optimization model of the isolation structure was constructed. The optimization of the isolation structure was carried out from the perspective of benefit analysis. Then, two buildings with the same structure were analyzed as examples. One kept the original isolation structure, and the other optimized the isolation structure with the optimization model. Findings: The final results showed that the optimized isolation structure had a lower input cost ratio, i.e. it had a higher benefit in the same whole life cycle, and the expected loss cost of the structure produced in the same life cycle was lower. Originality/value: In conclusion, the optimization model of the isolated structure based on benefit analysis can effectively improve the benefit of building isolation structure produced in the whole life cycle. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. {Keywords} Architectural design; Benefit analysis; Building isolation; Building technologies; Cost benefit analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Earthquakes; Isolated structures; Isolation bearing; Isolation structures; Large scale buildings; Life cycle; Optimization design; Optimization modeling; Parameter optimization; Risk assessment; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Whole life cycles {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Wu, J.; Shanghai Urban Construction Vocational CollegeChina; email: nw97433@163.com</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Castaldo, P., Tubaldi, E., Influence of ground motion characteristics on the optimal single concave sliding bearing properties for base-isolated structures (2018) Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 104, pp. 346-364; <br/>Chen, Y.J., Guo, K.M., Li, Y., Chen, F., Behavior of high damping seismic isolation rubber bearings for bridges (2015) Journal of Vibration and Shock, 34 (9). , 136-140, and 148;<br/>Fan, J., Long, X.H., Zhang, Y.P., Optimum design of lead-rubber bearing system with uncertainty parameters (2015) Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 56 (6), pp. 959-982;<br/>Ganji, M., Kazem, H., Comparing seismic performance of steel structures equipped with viscous dampers and lead rubber bearing base isolation under near-field earthquake (2017) Civil Engineering Journal, 3 (2), pp. 124-136;<br/>Han, Q., Wen, J., Du, X., Nonlinear response of continuous girder bridges with isolation bearings under bi-directional ground motions (2015) Journal of Vibroengineering, 17 (2), pp. 816-826;<br/>Kumar, M., Whittaker, A.S., Constantinou, M.C., Experimental investigation of cavitation in elastomeric seismic isolation bearings (2015) Engineering Structures, 101 (OCT.15), pp. 290-305;<br/>Li, H.Y., Fang, M.M., Xu, T., New anthracene-based organic dyes: the changeable position of the anthracene moiety bearing isolation groups in the conjugated bridge and the adjustable cell performance (2015) Organic Chemistry Frontiers, 3 (2), pp. 233-242;<br/>Lu, X., Wang, D., Wang, S., Investigation of the seismic response of high-rise buildings supported on tension-resistant elastomeric isolation bearings (2016) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 45 (13), pp. 2207-2228;<br/>Oh, J., Kim, J.H., Prediction of long-term creep deflection of seismic isolation bearings (2017) Journal of Vibroengineering, 19 (1), pp. 355-362;<br/>Rakshita, R.B., Krishnamoorthy, A., Response of a structure isolated with nonlinear rubber bearing (2018) International Journal of Civil Engineering & Technology, 9 (4), pp. 389-395;<br/>Sheng, T., Li, Y., Zhang, H., Field experiment study of subway nearby building's base isolation by laminated thick rubber isolator (2015) Journal of Building Structures, 36 (2), pp. 35-40;<br/>Tsai, C.S., Finite element formulations for friction pendulum seismic isolation bearings (2015) International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 40 (1), pp. 29-49;<br/>Wang, D., Lu, X., Experimental research on mechanical properties of anti-tension isolation bearing (2015) Journal of Building Structures, 13 (2), pp. 353-361;<br/>Xu, Z.F., Gai, P.P., Zhao, H.Y., Experimental and theoretical study on a building structure controlled by multi-dimensional earthquake isolation and mitigation devices (2017) Nonlinear Dynamics, 89 (9), pp. 723-740;<br/>Zhou, T., Wu, Y.F., Li, A.Q., Implementation and validation of a numerical model for lead-rubber seismic isolation bearings (2017) Journal of Mechanics, pp. 1-13</p>","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\PL7BG4W7\Wu - 2020 - Optimization design of building isolation structur.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJBPA-05-2020-0044","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Benefit analysis; Building isolation; Building technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Earthquakes; Isolated structures; Isolation bearing; Isolation structures; Large scale buildings; Life cycle; Optimizatio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, SSI is rarely considered in the design of building structures, and instead, buildings are frequently analyzed using a rigid base assumption and quasi-static loading conditions that ignore SSI and its dynamic nature. Acknowledging these shortcomings, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published in 2012 a set of recommendations on time-domain analyses of SSI for building structures compatible with standard finite element packages for consideration in engineering design. The so-called NIST GCR 12-917-21 report introduced a major simplification to enable frequency domain tools to be implemented in time domain analyses. That is, replacing the frequency-dependent soil impedance functions by a single-valued functions read at the flexible-base structure frequency; This work seeks to quantify the accuracy of this simplification considering fully coupled two-dimensional (2D) finite element models (FEM) as the reference. Using a Bayesian approach based on ensemble Kalman inversion (EnKI) and a range of numerical simulations of soil–foundation–building interaction, we estimate the optimal frequency that can be used to estimate soil impedance for time domain analyses; and we evaluate the improvement that the corresponding impedance offers relative to the full FEM results when compared to time domain analyses performed in accordance to the NIST recommendations outlined above. © The Author(s) 2021. {Keywords} Architectural design;

For the high-rise building steel structure design optimization system, users mainly contact with the functions of modeling, analysis, design checking and drawing. In fact, all these functions are carried out around the data stored behind. Three-dimensional high-rise building steel structure CAD pre-processing subsystem mainly integrates three-dimensional entity construction module, node design and editing module, construction drawing, processing drawing and CNC data output module. In this paper, the wall element is used to simulate the shear wall element, and the wall element can be automatically refined into a shell element composed of quadrilateral membrane element with rotational degree of freedom and generalized conforming bending plate element for thick and thin plate, which improves the speed and accuracy of analysis and calculation of shear wall. Various loads of high-rise building are calculated, especially the wind load of space action. It provides a new idea for wind load calculation of high-rise buildings. It is better to put forward a practical system optimization model, which can deal with the objective function, variables and constraints in a large number of engineering processing, and consider the actual constraints as fully as possible, which has strong practicability. © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net. {Keywords} Accuracy of analysis; Aerodynamic loads; Architectural design; Beams and girders; Bending plate element; Computer aided design; Computer aided design (CAD); Construction drawings; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Generalized conforming; High-rise building; Metal drawing; Object oriented; Object oriented method; Objective functions; Plates (structural components); Preprocessing systems; Processing system; Rotational degree of freedom; Shear walls; Steel construction; Steel structure; Steel structures; Structural design; Structural optimization; Tall buildings; Wind stress {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Lu, S.; Infrastructure Office, China; email: yuebu183441054@126.com</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; References: Omar, T., Nehdi, M.-L., Data acquisition technologies for construction progress tracking (2016) Automation in Construction, 70, pp. 143-155. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2016.06.016; Song, S., Yang, J., Kim, N., Development of a BIM-based structural framework optimization and simulation system for building construction (2015) IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, IEEE, 63 (9), pp. 895-912. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2012.08.013; Kaplan, H., Seireg, A., Optimal design of a base isolated system for a high ‐ rise steel structure (2015) Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 30 (2), pp. 287-302. , https://doi.org/10.1002/1096-9845(200102)30:2<287::AID-EQE13>3.0.CO;2-J; Park, S., Yeo, D.-H., Second-order effects on wind-induced structural behavior of high-rise steel buildings (2017) Journal of Structural Engineering, 144 (2), p. 04017209. , https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)st.1943-541x.0001943; Jung, E.-Y, Park, S.-S., Study on optimal design of mega-structure system for high-rise buildings (2017) Journal of the Architectural Institute of Korea Structure & Construction, 33 (3), pp. 21-28. , https://doi.org/10.5659/JAIK_SC.2017.33.3.21; Nemova, D., Reich, E., Subbotina, S., Khayrutdinova, F., Comparison of different types of transparent structures for high-rise buildings with a fully glazed facade (2015) Applied Mechanics & Materials, 725-726, pp. 26-33. , https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.725-726.26; Andrey, V., Safarik, D., Tabunschikov, Y., Murgul, V., The use of methods of structural optimization at the stage of designing high-rise buildings with steel construction (2018) E3S Web of Conferences, 33, pp. 03078-03014. , https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183303078; Hern á ndez, J, Peter, B., Van, D.-A., Richard, D., Jan-Derrick, B., An ifc interoperability framework for self-inspection process in buildings (2018) Buildings, 8 (2), pp. 32-40. , https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings8020032, Mart í n L.-P; Riaz, Z., Arslan, M., Kiani, A.-K., Azhar, S., CoSMoS: A BIM and wireless sensor based integrated solution for worker safety in confined spaces (2014) Automation in Construction, 45, pp. 96-106. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.010; Chen, K., Lu, W., Peng, Y., Rowlinson, S., Huang, G.-Q., Bridging BIM and building: From a literature review to an integrated conceptual framework (2015) International Journal of Project Management, 33 (6), pp. 1405-1416. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.006","; C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\VBN9F97I\Lu - 2020 - Optimization of Object-oriented 3D CAD Pre-process.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.14733/cadaps.2021.S3.106-117","Architectural design; Accuracy of analysis; Aerodynamic loads; Beams and girders; Bending plate element; Computer aided design; Computer aided design (CAD); Construction drawings; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Generalized conforming; High-rise building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional displacement-based design is limited to simple displacement targets, with optimization techniques (GA), it is feasibly to consider more performance chrematistics (e.g. costs, serviceability, etc.). By formulating drift targets and other structural design limit states within an elimination step of the GA optimization process, the method proposed here optimizes rocking wall design with multiple criteria that factor much more than lateral displacement targets in the seismic analysis. This type of optimization is difficult to perform using traditional manual trial-and-error approaches. An existing simplified nonlinear time-history simulation model (validated through full-scale shake table test data) of a wood rocking wall is employed in this process. The design for an example building in Seattle with a six-story rocking wall is presented using the proposed procedure. The results revealed that the optimization of the mass timber rocking wall lateral system can be achieved in a reasonable time frame using the proposed method. Even though the same drift limits were applied, final designs produced by GA varied, depending on the other optimization objectives. This demonstrates how the seismic design of wood rocking wall systems could be readily improved with computerized optimization tools that factor in other aspects of the design including cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; displacement; Displacement-based design; Displacement-based designs; Displacement-based seismic design; genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithm optimization; Genetic algorithms; Lateral displacements; Mass timber rocking wall; Multiple criteria; Nonlinear time history; Nonlinear time-history analysis; optimization; Optimization techniques; Optimization tools; Seattle; seismic design; Seismic design; Seismology; structural analysis; timber; Timber; Trial-and-error approach; United States; wall; Walls (structural partitions); Washington [United States]; Wooden buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Huang, D.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; email: huang@mymail.mines.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Fischer, D., Filiatrault, A., Folz, B., Uang, C.M., Seible, F., (2001), “Shake Table Tests of a Two-Story Woodframe House,” CUREE Publication No. W-06, CUREE-Caltech Woodframe Project; Folz, B., Filiatrault, A., Seismic analysis of woodframe structures.

FPA is characterised by simplicity in its formulation as well as high computational performance and it has been found to outperform other well-established algorithms in a range of diverse optimization problems. The present study applies, for first time, the FPA to the computationally challenging optimum design of real-world 3D reinforced concrete (RC) building frame structures after a set of appropriate modifications to its original formulation. To serve this goal, a new computationally efficient framework for the optimum design of 3D RC frames is developed that is interacting with the well-known software SAP2000 for the purposes of structural analysis and design. The framework is then applied to the minimum material cost design of a 4-storey and a 12-storey RC building in accordance with Eurocode regulations. It is found that the FPA exhibits better or similar computational performance than other well-established algorithms in these optimization tasks. Furthermore, parameter tuning analysis reveals the FPA parameter values that maximize its computational performance in the optimum structural design of 3D RC building frames. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} 3D reinforced concrete; Architectural design; Building frames; Computational efficiency; Computational performance; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Flower pollination algorithm; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Optimum designs; Parameter estimation; Parameter tuning; Parameters tuning; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete buildings; Structural design; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Mergos, P.E.; Senior Lecturer in Structural Engineering, United Kingdom; email: panagiotis.mergos.1@city.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Yang, X.S., Nature-inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms (2008), Luniver Press UK; Holland, J.H., Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems.

The method proposed in this study alternates between integer nonlinear programming and real number nonlinear programming to solve mixed integer nonlinear programming. Piecewise quadratic interpolation is used to obtain a differentiable and semi-continuous constraint function using the discrete analysis results from finite element analysis. Three analysis models representing various tall buildings with outriggers were used to perform the optimum design of the outrigger, which is subject to the lateral displacement constraint. The results demonstrate that as the number of outriggers used was increased, the total volume of the outriggers decreased. However, the performance of the outriggers remained almost the same when the number of the outriggers was greater than two. The optimum locations of the outriggers were slightly higher than those from the analytical solutions with simplified assumptions. The proposed method can be effectively used in other structural engineering applications that involve FEA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; design; Discrete analysis; Engineering applications; finite element method; Finite element method; Integer programming; Integer-nonlinear programming; interpolation; Interpolation; Lateral displacements; MINLP; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; multistorey building; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear programming; nonlinearity; optimization; Optimization; Outrigger; Quadratic interpolation; structural analysis; Tall building; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Cited By :15</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Kim, H.-S.; Department of Architecture, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, South Korea; email: hskim@konkuk.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Choi, H.S., Joseph, L., Outrigger system design considerations (2012) Int J High-Rise Build, 1 (3), pp. 237-246; <br/>Taranath, B.S., Optimum belt truss location for high-rise structures (1975) Struct Eng, 53 (8), pp. 345-347;<br/>McNabb, J.W., Muvdi, B.B., (1975), pp. 88-91. , Drift reduction factors for belt high-rise structures.

Actually, this system is attracting especially for tall buildings, which may not be suitable for base isolation because large tensile forces exert on them. This paper aims to investigate the control effect of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings that are represented as bending-shear type models. An optimum design criterion integrating stability maximization criterion is developed for such a multi-degree-of-freedom TMD floor integrated high-rise building system. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem with the combination of the stability maximization criterion and H∞ or H2 criterion. Two series of numerical simulations, that is, the cases in which all the floors serve as TMDs and only a limited number of floors serve as TMDs, are conducted. The favorable performance of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings is demonstrated by comparisons with a fixed floor building equipped with additional high-damping devices achieving 10% first modal damping ratio under a various of seismic excitations. The TMD floor system is verified to have satisfying control effect, which can also solve the post-earthquake long-duration vibration problem of high-rise buildings observed in the 2011 great Tohoku earthquake.

To meet this upcoming social demand on tall buildings, practical and efficient design method is proposed for optimal outrigger placement using topology optimization. Outriggers, one of the key structural components in a tall and narrow building, are the horizontal structures which connect the building core (spine) and the exterior surface in order to improve the building's shear stiffness. In the proposed method, the high-fidelity simulation model of a tall building is constructed with multiple finite element types for the core and the reinforcing truss system. The floor-wise outriggers are parameterized using the Simple Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and defined as the design variables. The outrigger placement problem is solved using topology optimization. The continuation method is used for material penalization parameter in order to obtain ""0-1"" design.

Previous studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the optimization of individual structural elements and the topological arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material cost are both reduced by 18–24% after performing optimization. The proposed approach can be extended to optimize other types of buildings (such as steel framework) with a similar problem nature, thereby improving the cost efficiency and environmental sustainability of the built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Carbon; Computational optimization; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Cost reduction; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; High rise building; High-rise buildings; Optimality criteria; Parametric design; Reinforced concrete; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Topology {Notes} <p>Cited By :16</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Chan, C.M.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong; email: cecmchan@ust.hk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2009), UNEP-SBCI, Buildings and Climate Change – Summary for Decision Makers, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); IEA, U.N.E.P., (2018), 2018 Global Status Report: towards a zero–emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector, International Energy Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme; Kofoworola, O.F., Gheewala, S.H., Environmental life cycle assessment of a commercial office building in Thailand (2008) Int.

The paper investigated an integrated decision-support framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in structural design optimisation. The aim of the study was to develop and test a systematic participatory model that utilises Building Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled technologies for data collection and group decision-making theory. The uncertainties associated with the decision-makers’ preferences were computed using Evidential Reasoning (ER) algorithms in the QFD house of quality. An actual decision scenario was used to test the proposed framework and investigate its capabilities in the context of reinforced concrete buildings. The study demonstrated how the proposed QFD model could effectively enhance decision-making by managing the diversity of stakeholders’ preferences via design integration, enhanced communication and shared domain knowledge. © 2018 The Authors {Keywords} Architectural design; BIM; Building Information Modelling; Concrete buildings; Decision making; Decision support; Decision support models; Decision support systems; Decision supports; Decision theory; Evidential reasoning; Group Decision Making; Group decision-making; Group theory; Participatory modeling; QFD; Quality function deployment; Quality function deployments (QFD); Reinforced concrete; Structural design; Structural optimisation; Structural optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Eleftheriadis, S.; Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, 14 Upper Woburn Place, United Kingdom; email: ucabele@ucl.ac.uk</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Huang, H.-Z., Gu, Y.-K., Du, X., An interactive fuzzy multi-objective optimization method for engineering design (2006) Artif.

In a CRSBF, post-tensioned (PT) strands and shear fuses are the distinct features providing the self-centering and energy dissipation mechanisms. As a relatively new structural system, there is a need to study this system’s optimal design. Control co-design has gained interest in recent years as a class of integrated engineering system design methods as an alternative to the traditional approach of optimizing the structural design and sequentially optimizing the control system’s design. It considers the direct relationship between physical and control system design decisions to discover non-obvious design solutions that enable new performance and functionality levels. This paper proposes a performance-based control co-design methodology for building structures integrating CRSBFs that concurrently minimizes the mainframe weight and determines the CRSBF design parameters subject to design code requirements as the optimization constraints. The patented neural dynamic model of Adeli and Park is used in this research to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. The seismic performance evaluation of the proposed methodology includes a shear frame and a nonlinear 6-story 3D building structure. The 6-story building model consists of 282 nodes with 1,692 degrees of freedom. A total of 610 frame elements, 8 PT strands with nonlinear material, and 32 nonlinear links are determined without requiring high-performance computing. Results show that the energy dissipation mechanism effectively reduces the seismic demand in structural members. The proposed performance-based control co-design methodology can lead to 21% reduction in the total weight of the 6-story frame structure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. {Keywords} Architectural design; Co-design methodology; Control co-design; Control systems; Controlled rocking steel braced frame; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic models; Dynamics; Energy dissipation; Energy dissipation mechanism; High performance computing; Integrated engineering; Neural dynamic model; Non-linear optimization problems; Nonlinear programming; Performance-based design; Seismic design; Seismic performance evaluation; Seismology; Shear fuse; Steel braced frames; Structural design; Structural frames; Systems analysis; Traditional approaches {Notes} <p>CODEN: SMOTB</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Gutierrez Soto, M.; Department of Civil Engineering, 161 Raymond Building, United States; email: mariant.gutierrezsoto@uky.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2014) Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings (Asce/Sei 41-13), , American society of civil engineers; <br/>Adeli, H., Karim, A., Scheduling/cost optimization and neural dynamics model for construction (1997) J Constr Eng Manag, 123 (4), pp. 450-458;<br/>Adeli, H., Park, H.S., Optimization of space structures by neural dynamics (1995) Neural Netw, 8 (5), pp. 769-781;<br/>Alavi, A., Dolatabadi, M., Mashhadi, J., Farsangi, E.N., Simultaneous optimization approach for combined control–structural design versus the conventional sequential optimization method (2020) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 63, pp. 1367-1383;<br/>Aldwaik, M., Adeli, H., Advances in optimization of highrise building structures (2014) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 50 (6), pp. 899-919;<br/>Aldwaik, M., Adeli, H., Cost optimization of reinforced concrete flat slabs of arbitrary configuration in irregular highrise building structures (2016) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 54 (1), pp. 151-164;<br/>Bertsekas, D.P., (2014) Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multiplier Methods, , Academic press;<br/>Bozca, M., Muğan, A., Temeltaş, H., Decoupled approach to integrated optimum design of structures and robust control systems (2008) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 36 (2), pp. 169-191;<br/>Burton, H.V., Lee, J.Y., Moradi, S., Dastmalchi, S., Multi-objective performance-based design optimization of a controlled rocking steel braced frame system (2019) Resilient Structures and Infrastructure, pp. 243-268. , Springer;<br/>(2012) Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings.

This benchmark building is a steel frame, accounting for nonlinear response via material non-linearity (bi-linear hysteresis) concentrated at the ends of moment-resisting beam-column joints, and is designed for the SAC PhaseIIISteel Project. In order to illustrate the real-world implementable optimal design approach for designing an optimal tuned impact damper system attached to practical complex structures, a reduced-order data-driven physical model is developed by using the response data specifically from finite element model and the optimization-based parameter identification algorithm. The reduced-order model has been iteratively constructed to be consistent favorably with the finite element model on the aspects of both modal frequencies and mode shapes. Based on the reduced-order model, the optimal parameters of the tuned impact damper system are subsequently designed by adopting proposed performance indices and the differential evolution algorithm conveniently. The optimal vibration control effects are evaluated by using the original finite element model structure with the optimal tuned impact damper. Such optimal performance is also compared with that of the original finite element model with a conventionally designed tuned impact damper system. The results show that the optimal designed tuned impact damper system not only can significantly mitigate the peak and root mean square values of dynamic displacements, but also can reduce effectively the number of plastic hinges of the nonlinear benchmark structure compared with that with the conventional design. Furthermore, the performance-based optimal design can lead to a better robust performance of the tuned impact damper system in the cases of the main structure subjected to unknown earthquake excitations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} algorithm; Architectural design; Benchmarking; building; Damping; Data reduction; Differential evolution algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; finite element method; Finite element method; Impact damper; Iterative methods; Optimal design; Optimal systems; optimization; Parameter estimation; Particle damper; Particle dampers; Passive control; performance assessment; Performance-based optimal design; Reduced order models; Reduced-order model; seismic response; Structural design; Structural optimization; Structural panels; structural response; Tuned impact damper {Notes} <p>Cited By :19</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Shan, J.; Research Institute of Structural Engineering and Disaster Reduction, China; email: jzshan@tongji.edu.cn</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Yao, J.T., Concept of structural control (1972) J Struct Div, ASCE, 98 (7), pp. 1567-1574; <br/>Housner, G.W., Bergman, L.A., Caughey, T.K., Chassiakos, A.G., Claus, R.O., Masri, S.F., Structural control: past, present, and future (1997) J Eng Mech.

The concept of the pavilion is based on a research project that explored the limits of material savings in building construction by implementing biomimetic optimisation strategies. Characteristic for the load-bearing tissues of living organisms, the principle of functional gradation was used to improve the structural efficiency of the pavilion by distributing material in accordance to a dominant stress state. As a result, the weight of the structure was reduced by 40% without decreasing its load-bearing capacity. This paper focuses on a description of the design process, in which material and production characteristics were embedded into a computational design environment and transformed into the geometric and structural properties of the pavilion. In parallel, a series of structural analyses have been conducted to validate design assumptions. The presented design approach demonstrates the potential for integrating the principles of structural optimisation into the process of architectural design for stimulating the joint work of the project team in developing integrated resource efficient solutions for the built environment.

In a shear-wall-based building, the conventional design process starts with an architect generating a floor plan, which is then passed to a structural engineer, who, based on knowledge and prior experience, tries to place shear walls to balance conflicting requirements: minimum structural weight, satisfactory structural strength and serviceability, conformity to architectural layout. This design process can be slow and inefficient, requiring a trial-and-error approach that is unlikely to lead to the best solution. The work presented in this paper intends to accelerate the process with an optimization system involving a ground structure program formulation, a modified evolutionary algorithm, and innovative computational techniques. Unlike existing work that focuses either exclusively on structural performance or architectural layout, this research integrates both. An efficient computational design methodology for shear wall layout in plan is introduced. The method minimizes structural weight with constraints on torsion, flexural strength, shear strength, drift, and openings and accessibility. It can be applied from the very beginning of floor plan design or after generating an architectural floor plan. This paper demonstrates the potential of this approach through a variety of case studies.

These applications have shown successful response reduction performance for tall buildings. The important dynamic responses of building structures with the IIS are the peak intermediate isolator drift (IID), and the peak inter-story drift (ISD). The semi-active intermediate isolation system (SAIIS) was developed to more effectively reduce these seismic responses. In previous study, the authors showed that the SAIIS using magnetorheological dampers successfully reduced both the IID and the ISD. However, the optimal design of the SAIIS only was conducted, without considering the building structure. If both the SAIIS and the building structure properties are considered in the optimal design procedure, more effective optimal design for both the SAIIS and the building structure can be achieved. In this research, a simultaneous multi-objective optimization (MOO) method of the SAIIS and the building structure is proposed to achieve this. Genetic algorithm was selected for simultaneous MOO of the SAIIS and the building structure. The fuzzy inference controller was selected as a control algorithm. The authors show that in comparison to the sequential optimization procedure that practical applications generally use, the simultaneous MOO method can provide much better control capacity and structural design process. © 2021, Korean Society of Steel Construction. {Keywords} Architectural design; Building structure; Fuzzy inference; Genetic algorithms; High rise building; Inference engines; Interstory drifts; Isolation systems; Magneto-rheological dampers; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Response reductions; Seismic response; Seismic response reduction; Semi-active intermediate isolation system; Sequential optimization; Simultaneous structural optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Kang, J.-W.; School of Architecture, South Korea; email: kangj@ynu.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Chey, M.H., Chase, J.G., Mander, J.B., Carr, A.J., Semi-active control of mid-story isolation building system (2009) Asia Korean Conference on Advanced Science & Technology, Yanji, China.; <br/>Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agrawal, S., Meyarivan, T., A Fast Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization: NSGA-II (2002) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6 (2), pp. 182-197;<br/>Garcia, D.L., Soong, T.T., Efficiency of a simple approach for the design of optimal damper configurations in MDOF structures (2002) Proceedings of the Third World Conference on Structural Control, pp. 431-436. , Como, Italy;<br/>Hur, M.W., Construction of isolation device for DONG-IL high-vill new city (2010) Review of Architecture and Building Science, 54 (5), pp. 81-86;<br/>Jun, D.H., Seismic response of R/C structures subjected to simulated ground motions compatible with design spectrum (2013) The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings, 21, pp. 74-91;<br/>Kim, H.S., Kang, J.W., Semi-active fuzzy control of a wind-excited tall building using multi-objective genetic algorithm (2012) Engineering Structures, 41, pp. 242-257;<br/>Kim, H.S., Kang, J.W., Optimal design of smart mid-story isolated control system for a high-rise building (2019) International Journal of Steel Structures, 19, pp. 1988-1995;<br/>Koo, J.H., Setareh, M., Murray, T.M., In search of suitable control methods for semi-active tuned vibration absorbers (2004) Journal of Vibration and Control, 10, pp. 163-174;<br/>Mele, E., Faiella, D., Inter-story isolation systems (IIS) for tall buildings: Design considerations (2018) Structural Engineering, CTBUH Journal, 2, pp. 34-41;<br/>Park, K.S., Koh, H.M., Preference-based optimum design of an integrated structural control system using genetic algorithms (2004) Advances in Engineering Software, 35, pp. 85-94;<br/>Park, K.S., Koh, H.M., Hahm, D., Integrated optimum design of viscoelastically damped structural systems (2004) Engineering Structures, 26, pp. 581-591;<br/>Sues, R.H., Mau, S.T., Wen, Y.K., (1988); Yi, F., Dyke, S.J., Caicedo, J.M., Carlson, J.D., Experimental verification of multi-input seismic control strategies for smart dampers (2001) Journal of Engineering Mechanics, 127 (11), pp. 1152-1164. , &;<br/>Zhang, R.H., Soong, T.T., Seismic design of viscoelastic dampers for structural applications (1992) Journal of Structural Engineering, 118 (5), pp. 1375-1392</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\VP6KCB53\Kim and Kang - 2021 - Simultaneous Multi-objective Optimization of Semi-.pdf","","Architectural design; Genetic algorithms; Interstory drifts; High rise building; Building structure; Fuzzy inference; Inference engines; Isolation systems; Magneto-rheological dampers; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a minimum compliance optimization formulation, developed by other researchers, is applied to a framed-tube structure. The tube behavior is modeled as a cantilevered box beam. Independent variable in this problem is thickness of the box, and a formulation for its optimal value is proposed. The challenge in this research was treatment of the lower bound constraint on thickness in an analytical manner. To deal with this constraint, a critical height parameter is introduced, and the design domain is divided into two zones of constant thickness and constant curvature. This definition allows for computation of optimal thickness distribution along the structure through an analytic dimensionless equation. Most of the previously published papers in the field of tall structures are suitable for abstract analyses but not for design. In addition, most of them are computer-based. Considering these limitations, the current research presents a hand-calculation method for preliminary design, suitable for sensitivity analyses and parametric studies. As the presented formulations are dimensionless, they are applicable in any dimensional system. Different static loading patterns are considered; including the concentrated, uniform, triangular and quadratic forms. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the ease of the proposed method in application, and the analysis results are presented by charts to validate the efficiency of it. {Keywords} Architectural design;

Conventional optimization techniques usually are aimed at achieving the globally optimal solution which maximizes the structural performance. In practical applications, however, designers usually desire to have multiple design options, as the single optimal design often limits their artistic intuitions and sometimes violates the functional requirements of building structures. Here we propose three stochastic approaches to generating diverse and competitive designs. These approaches include (1) penalizing elemental sensitivities, (2) changing initial designs, and (3) integrating the genetic algorithm into the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are capable of producing a series of random designs, which possess not only high structural performance, but also distinctly different topologies. These approaches can be easily implemented in different topology optimization techniques. This work is of significant practical importance in architectural engineering where multiple design options of high structural performance are required. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. {Keywords} Architectural design; Architectural engineering; BESO; Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations; Computer aided engineering; Conventional optimization; Functional requirement; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Optimal systems; Optimization techniques; Practical importance; Random and competitive structural designs; Shape optimization; Stochastic systems; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Structural performance; Topology; Topology optimization {Notes} <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>CODEN: FEADE</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Xie, Y.M.; Centre for Innovative Structures and Materials, Australia; email: mike.xie@rmit.edu.au</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Bendsøe, M.P., Kikuchi, N., Generating optimal topologies in structural design using a homogenization method (1988) Comput.

For the engineering analysis, first, the wall thickness and length are required to check the building deformation limits, base shear strength, among other parameters. For this reason, the present investigation develops a structural design platform for reinforced concrete wall buildings that uses a deep neural network to predict the wall's thickness and length based on previous architectural and engineering projects. The study includes, in the first place, the surveying of the architectural and engineering plans for a total of 165 buildings constructed in Chile; the generated database has the geometric and topological definition of the walls and the slabs. As a second stage, a model was trained for the regression of the wall segments’ thickness and length, making use of a feature vector that models the variation between the architectural and the engineering plans for a set of conditions such as the thickness, connectivity (vertical and horizontal), area, wall density, the distance between elements, wall angles, foundation soil type, among other engineering parameters. The regression model results in terms of R2-value are 0.995 and 0.994 for the predicted wall thickness and length, respectively, proving to be a reliable method for the initial engineering wall definition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; architecture; artificial neural network; building; Building design; Chile; Deep neural networks; Design; Engineering plans; Feature engineering; Feature engineerings; Floor plan layout; Floor plan layouts; machine learning; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Neural network; Neural-networks; regression analysis; Regression analysis; reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced concrete buildings; Shear walls; Structural design; Structure; Structuring; Wall; Wall thickness {Notes} <p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Massone, L.M.; Department of Civil Engineering, Blanco Encalada 2002, Chile; email: lmassone@ing.uchile.cl</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2012), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST GCR 12-917-18 “Comparison of U.S. and Chilean Building Code Requirements and Seismic Design Practice 1985–2010;; Massone, L.M., Bonelli, P., Lagos, R., Lüders, C., Moehle, J., Wallace, J.W., Seismic Design and Construction Practices for R.C.

To achieve this goal, careful assessment of risk from future hazards is required. In practice, the risk to building structures is regulated by structural design codes through target reliability levels, which are reflected in many code factors, including partial safety factors, load combination factors, and modification factors. Optimizing the target reliability levels often requires running a large number of nonlinear dynamic analyses of complex finite element models, which imposes a significant burden on the computational resources. Computation time can be reduced considerably by employing surrogate models that can efficiently approximate the relation between input design and hazard intensity variables with building response output. This paper explores the different surrogate models, namely, support vector machines, kriging, and neural networks, for structural response prediction of a building class so that they can be used in the target reliability index optimization of a building class (a group of buildings with the same load-carrying characteristics). The uniqueness of this study is in developing a single surrogate model for a group of buildings instead of a single building design. The investigation on the performance of the surrogate models in structural response prediction is conducted for mid-rise office building class by comparing the computation time, accuracy, and robustness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Building class; Computational resources; Forecasting; Hazards; Load combination factors; Load-carrying characteristics; Modification factors; Office buildings; Partial safety factor; Reliability; Risk assessment; Safety factor; Seismic response estimation; Steel moment-resisting frame; Structural design; Structural design codes; Structural response prediction; Support vector machines; Surrogate model; Target reliability index; Target reliability index optimization {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Cha, E.J.; Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, 205 N Mathews Ave, United States; email: ejcha@illinois.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2016), ASCE 7.

Many studies have been conducted on the sustainable design of buildings, but few have studied the sustainable design of shear walls considering CO 2 emissions. Herein, a sustainable design model for shear walls is developed to analyze the relationship between building height, CO 2 emissions, and construction cost. The model is applied to the sustainable design of shear walls installed in a 42-story mixed-use building. The characteristics in the change in CO 2 emissions and the construction cost according to the building height were analyzed using the slenderness ratio as a variable. The results indicated that as the slenderness ratio increased, the CO 2 emissions increased almost linearly in proportion to the height. In particular, when the slenderness ratio increased from 4.40 to 4.93, which is known to be the limit of the efficient applicability of shear walls, the CO 2 emissions tended to increase more rapidly. When the slenderness ratio was 4.93, the CO 2 emissions for the shear wall were reduced to 27.24% by the proposed model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; building; Building height; Building materials; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; CO2 emissions; Construction; Construction costs; Construction material cost; cost analysis; Cost benefit analysis; design; Design of buildings; Ecodesign; Embodied CO 2 emissions; Korea; Office buildings; Office buildings with shear walls; Optimal structural design; Optimal structural designs; Shear walls; Slenderness ratios; Structural design; Structural optimization; Support systems; Sustainable design model; Sustainable development; Vertical members; wall {Notes} <p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>CODEN: BUEND</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Park, H.S.; Department of Architectural Engineering, South Korea; email: hspark@yonsei.ac.kr</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1997), UNFCCC; De T'Serclaes, P., Financing Energy Efficient Homes (2007), IEA Information Paper Paris, France; UNFCCC, Adoption of the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2015), UNFCCC; Karimpour, M., Belusko, M., Xing, K., Bruno, F., Minimising the life cycle energy of buildings: review and analysis (2014) Build.

For a building of this height, wind forces and associated wind-induced motion in the upper levels can become dominant factors in the structural design of its foundations and lateral-stability system. This article describes how an initial aerodynamic shape-optimisation workshop allowed the design team to develop a finely tuned architectural form capable of minimising the detrimental effects of vortex shedding. This process, approx. 10 hours of wind tunnel time, was able to deliver key design information (e.g. peak dynamic overturning moments and wind-induced peak accelerations) in real time for a total of 17 aerodynamic variations of the tower form: a result which, previously, would only have been possible through an extensive and time-consuming campaign of wind tunnel tests. The way in which the wind loading was then refined, making use of simultaneous pressure integration and aeroelastic techniques, will also be described. Details about other wind engineering studies, aimed at investigating the pedestrian-level wind microclimate, the facade wind pressure, as well as the stack effect, will also be briefly presented. © The Institution of Structural Engineers. {Keywords} Aerodynamic shape; Aerodynamic variations; Aerodynamics; Architectural design; Design information; Overturning moment; Republic of China; Structural dynamics; Super tall buildings; Tall buildings; Wind effects; Wind induced motions; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels {Notes} <p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>CODEN: SEPAD</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Cammelli, S.; BMT Fluid MechanicsUnited Kingdom</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2018) LEED, , https://new.usgbc.org/leed, US Green Building Council; <br/>(2011) Announcement of the Alan G, , www.iawe.org/about/Wind_Loading_Chain.pdf, International Association of Wind Engineering, Davenport Wind Loading Chain;<br/>(2006) GB 50009-2001: Load Code for the Design of Building Structures, , China National Standards;<br/>(2010) ESDU Item 01008: Computer Program for Wind Speeds and Turbulence Properties: Flat Or Hilly Sites in Terrain with Roughness Changes, , Engineering Sciences Data Unit;<br/>Tschanz, T., Davenport, A.G., The base balance technique for the determination of dynamic wind loads (1983) J.

In order to account for the uncertainties in random wind excitation, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive and reliable dynamic optimisation technique in the time domain. The optimal lateral stiffness design problem of wind-excited tall buildings consists of (1) identifying the critical dynamic drift response in the time domain and (2) searching for the optimal distribution of element stiffness of the building subject to multiple drift design constraints. The critical time-history drift constraints of a wind-excited building are first treated by the worst-case formulation and then explicitly expressed in terms of element sizing variables using the principle of virtual work. The extreme value distribution and the Gaussian assumption are employed to formulate and simplify the probabilistic drift constraints, which are explicitly considered in the dynamic optimisation problem. The system reliability associated with the interstory drift is estimated approximately by the bound approach to ensure that the most cost-efficient solution also attains an acceptable reliability level. A full-scale 45-story building example under wind tunnel derived time history wind loading is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the reliability-based dynamic optimisation technique. © 2015, © 2014 Taylor & Francis. {Keywords} Architectural design; dynamic response optimisation; Equivalent static loads; Extreme value distributions; Optimal distributions; Optimisations; peak factor; Peak factor; Principle of virtual work; Probability distributions; reliability; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Stiffness; Stochastic systems; Structural design; tall buildings; Tall buildings; Time domain analysis; time history analysis; Time history analysis; Wind resistant design of tall buildings; Wind tunnels {Notes} <p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Bao, S.; Institute of Structural Engineering, China</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: (2001) Manual of steel construction: Load and resistance factor design, , 3rd ed., Chicago, IL: American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC); <br/>(2005) Guide for numerical prediction of wind loads on buildings;<br/>Arora, J.S., Wang, Q., Review of formulations for structural and mechanical system optimization (2005) Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 30, pp. 251-272;<br/>(1999) Wind tunnel studies of buildings and structures, 67. , ASCE manuals and reports on engineering practice, New York, NY: American Society of Civil Engineers;<br/>Chan, C.M., How to optimize tall steel building frameworks (1997) Guide to structural optimization.

A demonstration of the toolbox is given where the toolbox has been used for an elementary implementation of a simulation of co-evolutionary design processes. The optimisation approaches and the toolbox that are presented in this paper will be used in future efforts for research into- and development of optimisation methods for multi-disciplinary building spatial design optimisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} Architectural design; Building optimisation; Building physics; Buildings; Co-evolutionary; Large solutions; Multi-disciplinary optimisation; Optimisation method; Optimisation procedures; Optimisations; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Super-structures; Thermal Performance {Notes} <p>Cited By :15</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Boonstra, S.; Eindhoven University of TechnologyNetherlands; email: s.boonstra@tue.nl</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Boonstra, S., van der Blom, K., Hofmeyer, H., Amor, R., Emmerich, M.T.M., (2016), pp. 281-290. , Super-structure and super-structure free design search space representations for a building spatial design in multi-disciplinary building optimisation, in: EG-ICE 2016, Electronic Proceedings of the 23rd EG-ICE Workshop, Jagiellonian University ZPGK; Voll, P., Lampe, M., Wrobel, G., Bardow, A., Superstructure-free synthesis and optimization of distributed industrial energy supply systems (2012) Energy, 45 (1), pp. 424-435; <br/>Wetter, M., (2004), Simulation-based Building Energy Optimization, Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley; Tuhus-Dubrow, D., Krarti, M., Genetic-algorithm based approach to optimize building envelope design for residential buildings (2010) Build.

The design information of the material layout may be helpful in dealing with large-scale safety design issues in civil or architectural engineering fields, against natural phenomena, such as winds and earthquakes. The material topology optimization method evaluates an optimal layout reinforcing or arranging material of a specified volume in a given design space that maximizes stiffness for a given set of loads and boundary conditions. Generating the optimal distribution of material is similar to the so-called strut-and-tie method using truss members of straight lines, and it leads to the stiffest structures. Numerical applications verify that the present material topology optimization method is an applicable concept design tool to create effective layout designs of material in given structural frames in civil and building industries. © 2012 Sharif University of Technology.

Three methods are explored to evaluate the dynamic response – the time domain, frequency domain, and state space methods – and the associated design variable sensitivities are derived analytically. The resulting stochastic dynamic topology optimization problem is solved using the gradient-based optimizer Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Sensitivities are computed using the adjoint method and the popular Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) is used to achieve clear existence of structural members. The approach is used to design the lateral load systems of structures that minimize the variance of the system response to stationary stochastic ground motion excitation. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the differences between topologies optimized for stochastic ground motion and topologies optimized for equivalent static loading. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The transfer function amplitude of the top displacement and the elastic base shear force evaluated at the first natural circular frequency of structures are chosen as objective functions. The damper coefficients of the added viscous dampers are taken into consideration as design variables in a planar building frame. Transfer function amplitude of the top displacement and the amplitude of the elastic base shear force at the fundamental natural frequency are minimized under an active constraint on sum of the damper coefficients of the added dampers. According to two specified objective functions, an optimization algorithm based on the ABCA is proposed. The proposed method is verified by a gradient-based algorithm; steepest direction search algorithm (SDSA). The proposed ABCA and the SDSA are applied to find the optimal damper distribution for a nine-storey planar building then the optimal damper allocation obtained from the ABCA is investigated to rehabilitate models of irregular planar buildings. The validity of the proposed method was demonstrated through a time history analysis of the optimal damper designs, which were determined based on the frequency domain using the ABCA. The numerical results of the proposed optimal damper design method show that the use of the ABCA can be a practical and powerful tool to determine the optimal damper allocation in planar building structures.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. {Keywords} Architectural design; Frequency domain analysis; Numerical methods; Structural design; Structural optimization; Transfer functions {Notes} <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\bunjii\Zotero\storage\U6D47JYS\Sonmez et al. - 2013 - Using an artificial bee colony algorithm for the o.pdf","","Architectural design; Structural design; Structural optimization; Frequency domain analysis; Numerical methods; Transfer functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For structural engineers, the most effective approach to control the wind-induced responses of high-rise buildings would be to control the stiffness or natural frequency of the building. This paper presents a practical design model to control the wind-induced responses of a high-rise building. In the model, the stiffness of a high-rise building is maximized to increase the natural frequency of the building by the resizing algorithm. The proposed design model is applied to control the wind-induced vibration of an actual 37-storey building during the initial stage of its structural design.

Performance-based wind-resistant structural optimization can effectively reduce the material cost of supertall buildings in the premise of ensuring their structural safety and serviceability. For modern supertall buildings with complex structural systems, the formulation of its structural optimization problem is highly complicated. Moreover, the optimization problem itself is also nonlinear and extensive in scale. This study first addresses the optimization formulation of complex structure system which includes concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) frame members and shear wall members. These structural members are often used in supertall buildings but are seldom discussed in existing literature of structural optimization. Then, the interior point algorithm, which is propitious for large-scale nonlinear optimization, is used to seek the optimal design solution. A real-life supertall building, the 432 m Guangzhou West Tower, is used as an example to examine the effectiveness of the proposed computer-based optimization method. The proposed method is shown to work effectively in the optimal wind-resistant design of supertall buildings with complex structural systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer

This paper introduces a wind-resistant optimal design method of supertall buildings based on HFFB wind tunnel experiments. Based on the HFFB wind tunnel test and wind-induced vibration analysis, it provides a reliable and efficient method for structural optimization of supertall buildings with different types of structural members and multiple constraints. Taking advantage of the classic linear mode shape assumption of the HFFB technique, this paper also presents an alternative routine that transforms all different types of constraints into a uniform frequency constraint, which significantly reduces the computational intensity while still offers acceptable accuracy of optimization results. Moreover, the sensitivity of the optimization results to the adopted basic wind pressure value is discussed. The total material cost of the optimized structure increases exponentially with the increase of the basic wind pressure, indicating that the structural costs of supertall buildings are quite sensitive to the adopted basic wind pressure for structural design and its value should be precisely determined by the wind climate analysis of the construction site. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd {Keywords} architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; HFFB; High frequency force balances; Mathematical transformations; multistorey building; Optimal design methods; Optimisations; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Super tall buildings; Tall building; Tall buildings; vibration; Vibration analysis; Vibrations analysis; Wind induced vibrations; Wind pressures; wind stress; Wind stress; wind tunnel; Wind tunnel experiment; Wind tunnel test; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels {Notes} <p>CODEN: ENSTD</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Fu, J.; Research Center for Wind Engineering and Engineering Vibration, China; email: jiyangfu@gzhu.edu.cn</p>; <p>Export Date: 25 November 2021</p>; <p>References: Chan, C.M., Chui, J.K.L., Wind-induced response and serviceability design optimization of tall steel buildings (2006) Eng Struct, 28 (4), pp. 503-513; <br/>Xu, A., Zhao, R.H., Wind-resistant structural optimization of a supertall building with complex structural system (2020) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 62 (6), pp. 3493-3506;<br/>Zhang, L.-L., Li, J., Peng, Y., Dynamic response and reliability analysis of tall buildings subject to wind loading (2008) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 96 (1), pp. 25-40;<br/>Bandi, E.K., Tamura, Y., Yoshida, A., Yong, C.K., Yang, Q., Experimental investigation on aerodynamic characteristics of various triangular-section high-rise buildings (2013) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 122 (11), pp. 60-68;<br/>Beck, A.T., Kougioumtzoglou, I.A., Santos, K.R.M., , pp. 145-153. , Optimal performance-based design of non-linear stochastic dynamical RC structure subjected to stationary wind excitation2014;Eng Struct 78:; Xu, A., Xie, Z.N., Fu, J.Y., Wu, J.R., Tuan, A., Evaluation of wind loads on super-tall buildings from field-measured wind-induced acceleration response (2014) Struct Des Tall Spec Build, 23 (9), pp. 641-663;<br/>Choi, S.W., Seo, J.H., Lee, H.M., Kim, Y., Wind-induced response control model for high-rise buildings based on resizing method.

In many cases the piled rafts settlements are likely to be large, which leads to an increase of the pile length and/or number of piles required to reduce the settlements. However, this increase does not satisfy the design requirements or an economical design. The majority of piled raft foundations has been designed with a uniform pile length and configuration. This paper describes the process of optimizing the design of a piled raft foundation for a high rise building in the Mazandaran province in Iran by considering an economical design methodology in which piles are placed more densely beneath the maximum load positions when the piled raft is subjected to non-uniform loads. By using the ELPLA software in the analysis process, the validity of the software is examined through the results of a report prepared on behalf of Technical Committee TC18 on piled foundations. The study shows that the pile arrangement method can help to considerably reduce the total and differential settlements with similar total pile length as well as the induced bending moments and shear forces of the raft. This study can help practicing engineers to choose pile and raft parameters with the pile arrangement method to produce an economical design.  2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","2016","2024-04-02 09:27:37","2024-04-02 09:27:37","","75-85","","1","34","","Geotechnical and Geological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10706-015-9929-x","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Piles; Pile foundations; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 3_Weight/Mass; 2_Others (Not Specified); 7_Part of building (Piled raft)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are commonly used for low-rise commercial, light industrial and agricultural buildings. In this paper, the effect of stressed-skin action on the optimum design of CFS portal frames is investigated by conducting a minimum cost design optimisation on a building of span of 6 m, height-to-eaves of 3 m and frame spacing of 3 m; the effect of different number of bays are considered. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that gables are rigid.The effect of stressed-skin action is larger for""square-shaped"" buildings (i.e. when the span and length are the same on plan) and decreases as more bays are added(i.e. as the building becomes more ""rectangular-shaped"" on plan). The results of the minimum cost optimisation indicate that if stressed-skin action is taken into account, the cost of the internal frame can be reduced by around half for ""square-shaped"" buildings. It should be noted that this is a minimum cost optimisation, which is not the same as a minimum weight optimisation. It is also shown that a safe design of internal frames could be obtained by ignoring wind loads (i.e. designing the frame only for gravity loads),but this is limited to buildings having a ""square-shape"".  2016, Korean Society of Steel Construction and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2016","2024-04-02 09:27:36","2024-04-02 09:27:36","","299-307","","2","16","","International Journal of Steel Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13296-016-6004-2","Architectural design; Structural design; Costs; Studs (structural members); 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 5_Spatial (Warehouse)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of solving this problem, the authors proposed numerical optimization algorithms based on conditionally extreme methods of mathematical programming. The problem of conditional minimization is reduced to a problem of an unconditional extreme using two modified Lagrange functions. The advantage of the proposed methodology is a wide range of convergence, the absence of requirements for convexity of functions on an admissible set of variation parameters, as well as high convergence, which can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the objective and constraint functions. Verification of the developed methodology was carried out by solving a well-known example of ten-bar truss optimization. A comparison of the results obtained by other sources with the copyright ones confirmed the effectiveness of the presented algorithms. As an example, the problems of optimizing the cross-section of a steel beam have also been solved. Automation of the algorithms is performed in mathematical package MathCAD, which allows you to visually trace the sequence of commands, as well as obtain graphs that reflect the state of the task at each iteration. Thus, the authors obtained an original methodology for solving the optimization problem of flat bar structures, which can be extended to solve the problem of optimal design of general structures, where the optimality criterion is defined as material consumption, and the given structural requirements are presented as constraint functions.  2022 St-Petersburg State Polytechnical University.

The structure is modeled as a shear frame and considered as linear. The upper and lower limit values of the dampers are defined as passive constraints, while the damping coefficients of the dampers placed in each storey are considered as the design variables. The use of these technological tools in construction has caused a serious cost increase. It is therefore important to use minimum of these elements. For this reason, the sum of the damping coefficients of the dampers is regarded as the objective function and is minimized as an indication of the capacities of the dampers placed in the building stories and thus their costs. It is well known that the addition of dampers to the structure increases the damping ratio of the structure. A new active constraint is included in the optimization problem as the target damping ratio. The equation required for the calculation of the value of the target damping ratio corresponding to any mode is also derived. The simple optimization problem is solved using three different optimization algorithms: Simulated Annealing, Nelder Mead and Differential Evolution algorithms. Optimum designs are found to minimize the cost function and provide all constraints. In the shown numerical example, the effect of the variation of the building period and the changes of the target damping ratio on the optimization is investigated. Furthermore, earthquake behavior of the structure corresponding to these optimum designs is investigated using El Centro Earthquake (NS) record and examined in terms of period and additional damping ratios of the maximum displacements to the floors. In addition, the proposed method finds the optimum damper distribution considering the first two modes. The proposed optimum damper design method is very simple and it is a method which reaches the optimum designs in different mode behaviors. As a result, it has been shown in the numerical examples that the optimum damper design can be changed according to the variations of the designer's constraints.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:36","2024-04-02 09:27:36","","17-28","","","439","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2018.09.031","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Damping; Evolutionary algorithms; Earthquakes; Office buildings; Efficiency; Simulated annealing; Cost functions; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Cost; 1_Others (damper); 2_Others (damper); 7_Building_Component (damper)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of this technique, which leads to optimum structures, mostly results in esthetic, lightweight, and best performance from the perspective of engineers or architects. However, the topology optimization results are not usually known for direct realization in practice, and the engineer and architect should be able to choose the best solution among numerous choices in close cooperation. This paper has focused on defining a parametric framework of continuous optimum design of lateral bracing systems for tall buildings considering wind and gravity loads. The bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method was employed, considering the main optimization parameter, loading scenarios, and constraints. In order to show the effectiveness of the suggested topology optimization framework for minimizing compliance (maximizing stiffness) and minimum consumption of materials in the design of lateral bracing systems, 2D and 3D systems have been discussed. According to the obtained results, this framework could employ topology optimization during the conceptual design to seek a new definition of the optimum layout of lateral bracing systems with high structural performance, elegant geometries, and other characteristics considered by architects and engineers.  2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:36","2024-04-02 09:27:36","","","","4","27","","Journal of Architectural Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000511","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Conceptual design; Engineers; Structural optimization; Topology; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 1_Topology; 7_Entire building; 3_Stiffness (Compliance)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous works demonstrated that the TMDI leads to efficient broadband vibration control for a range of different structures under different dynamic excitations. This paper proposes a novel optimal TMDI design formulation to address occupants comfort in wind-excited slender tall buildings susceptible to vortex shedding (VS) effects and to explore optimal TMDI's potential for transforming part of the wind-induced kinetic energy to usable electricity in tall buildings. Attention is focused on investigating benefits of TMDIs with different inertial properties (i.e., secondary mass/weight and inertance) configured in different topologies defined by the number of floors spanned by the inerter device to connect the secondary mass to the building structure. Optimally designed TMDIs for a wide range of inertial properties and three different topologies are obtained through numerical solution of the underlying optimization problem for a benchmark 305.9 m tall building with more than 6 height-to-width ratio subjected to experimentally calibrated spatially-correlated across-wind force field accounting for VS effects. Fixed performance design graphs on the TMDI inertial (mass-inertance) plane are furnished demonstrating that any fixed structural performance level in terms of occupants comfort (i.e., peak top floor acceleration) can be achieved through lightweight TMDIs as long as sufficient inertance is provided. Further, TMDI robustness to host structure properties and to reference wind velocity is shown to increase by increasing inertance or by spanning more floors in connecting the secondary mass with the host structure by the inerter. Lastly, it is found that increased available energy for harvesting in wind excited tall buildings is achieved by incorporating electromagnetic motors in TMDIs with varying damping property, while concurrent reduced floor acceleration and increased available energy for harvesting is accomplished by TMDI topologies with inerters spanning more floors.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:36","2024-04-02 09:27:36","","","","","204","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109904","Architectural design; Floors; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Topology; Acoustic devices; Structural properties; Energy harvesting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Vortex flow; Vortex shedding; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Building_Component (TMD); 3_Others (damper parameter); 1_Others (damper, interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the proposed framework is based on first reformulating the bi-objective stochastic optimization problem into a suite of single-objective optimization problems through the -constraint approach. Secondly, a new optimization sub-problem is introduced for efficiently solving the single-objective problems, whose formulation is based on combining the auxiliary variable vector approach with a new kriging-enhanced approximation scheme. Because the sub-problem can be fully calibrated and subsequently solved from the results of a single performance assessment carried out in a fixed point of the design space, efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional problems is achieved. Through solving a sequence of sub-problems, solutions to the -constraint problems are obtained leading to the identification of the Pareto-optimal solutions of the original bi-objective optimization problem. To illustrate the applicability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework, an example of application to a large-scale structure is presented, where structural material volume and a system-level loss measure defined in terms of expectation and standard deviation of the total repair cost are simultaneously minimized.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:36","2024-04-02 09:27:36","","40-52","","","190","","Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2019.03.028","Architectural design; Structural design; Stochastic systems; Efficiency; Pareto principle; Scalability; Monte Carlo methods; Intelligent systems; Kriging; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It creates opportunities for novel shapes that would not have been technologically feasible in the past. The key to this revolution resides in the link between material development and computational-based optimization design tools to produce optimized structures. Topology optimization is an intelligent approach to seek the best design in many fields of computational mechanics. By analysing the information inside the determined domain, it changes the topology of such domain into a new design to satisfy the given criterion. In most of the work, ideal materials are assumed to implement the topology optimization problems. Therefore, the optimal designs are still considered as reference or theoretical solutions while the practical problems need more than that. The multi-material topology optimization (MMTOP) is established to evaluate the behaviour of many materials in a problem and give an applicable solution for design. In this study, we present a polytree-based adaptive methodology for multi-material topology optimization (MMTOP). Polytree data structure is introduced as a general recursive multi-level mesh that is automatically refined in processing based on error analysis. A new definition of filter radius is also proposed to improve the efficiency of filters and optimized results. The combination of polytree meshes and adaptive filters not only clarifies the interfaces between material phases (including void phase), but also decreases the computing time of the overall process in comparison to using the regular fine meshes. Several benchmark and practical problems are considered to show distinct features of the proposed method. 3D printed prototypes are presented to demonstrate the fabrication feasibility of this method.  2018","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:35","2024-04-02 09:27:35","","79-90","","","99","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.005","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Finite element method; Structural optimization; Topology; Additives; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Computational mechanics; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 7_Entire building; 5_Others (Not specified); 3_Stiffness (Compliance); 2_Others (plastic)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventionally, the frequency constraint for the structural optimal design of a tall building is formulated through the strain energy method, and with the objective functions and constraint functions being established, the structural optimization problem is mathematically modeled, and the corresponding solution is solved using the optimal criteria (OC) method. This procedure has two disadvantages. First, the strain energy usually does not consider the gradient of the structural internal forces to the design variables, and so the computed sensitivity of the frequency constraint is inaccurate. Second, in the OC method, the Lagrangian multipliers are computed by solving a set of linear equations using the GaussSeidel method, which may lead to inaccurate results. To overcome these disadvantages, a new method is proposed by using an eigenvalue approach for computing the sensitivity of the frequency constraint and a quadratic programming approach for computing the Lagrangian multipliers. It is shown that the proposed new method can perform accurate wind-resistant structural optimal design for tall buildings and make the iterations of the optimal design converge faster and more stable. 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:35","2024-04-02 09:27:35","","","","18","27","","Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tal.1549","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind stress; Finite element method; Aerodynamic loads; Constrained optimization; Structural optimization; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Strain energy; Lagrange multipliers; Quadratic programming; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidently, the types of structures have significant effects on the land use, energy demand, and carbon emissions of buildings. This paper presents an extensive review of currently adopted sustainable structural design strategies, thereby emphasizing the need for a comprehensive optimization approach to minimize the buildings carbon footprint. However, a design optimization problem involves hundreds of design variables and requires long computation time. To overcome these issues, a parametric study should be prior conducted to estimate the interrelationships and the influence of structural design variables on the final embodied emissions. In this research, a flat plate building is investigated considering different column spacings, concrete strengths, structural component sizes, detailed reinforcements, and for the application of Reinforced Concrete (RC) and Post-Tensioned (PT) construction techniques. While the most sustainable designs of slab systems are attained with shorter slab spans and thinner slab depths, columns having less longitudinal reinforcement with a moderate rise in dimensions are the best options. Furthermore, the employment of pre-stressed tendons results in a significant decrease in material requirements and related embodied impacts, by 26.333.5% and 26.633.8%, respectively. The outcomes indicated that reduction in a building's self-weight does not necessarily mean a decline in embodied emissions, highlighting the trade-offs between material saving and material carbon intensiveness in the decisions towards sustainable design and construction.  2021","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:35","2024-04-02 09:27:35","","","","","315","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128123","Architectural design; Structural design; Economic and social effects; Ecodesign; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable development; Plates (structural components); Carbon footprint; Land use; 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a focus on the long span building typology, this research employs a MOO approach that uses both finite element structural modeling and building energy simulations simultaneously to generate optimized building shapes that are not constrained to regular, rectilinear geometric configurations. Through a series of case studies that explore performance tradeoffs of enclosed arches and static overhangs in different climates, this paper shows how MOO can yield architecturally expressive, high-performing designs, which makes the process more attractive to designers searching for creative forms. It also provides new insight into specific design responses to various climatic constraints, since optimization that considers both structure and energy can shift best solutions in unexpected ways. Finally, by displaying performance results in terms of embodied and operational energy, this paper presents new data showing how considerations of structural material efficiency compare in magnitude to total building energy usage. Together, these three contributions can influence current sustainable design strategies for building typologies that have significant structural requirements.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2024-04-02 09:27:35","2024-04-02 09:27:35","","748-761","","","127","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.05.090","Architectural design; Structural design; Conceptual design; Finite element method; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Constrained optimization; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 4_MOO (2); 5_Spatial (Roof); 1_Shape (interesting); 3_Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shape modifications to improve the building's aerodynamic properties. On the other hand, it is well-known that the cross-section geometry has a direct impact in the floor area availability and subsequently in the buildings profitability. Hence, it is of interest for the designers to find the balance between these two design criteria that may require contradictory design strategies. This study proposes a surrogate-based multi-objective optimization framework to tackle this design problem. Closed-form equations provided by the Eurocode are used to obtain the wind-induced responses for several wind directions, seeking to develop an industry-oriented approach. CFD-based surrogates emulate the aerodynamic response of the building cross-section, using as input parameters the cross-section geometry and the wind angle of attack. The definition of the buildings modified plan shapes is done adopting the reduced basis approach, advancing the current strategies currently adopted in aerodynamic optimization of civil engineering structures. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved with both the classical weighted Sum Method and the Weighted Min-Max approach, which enables obtaining the complete Pareto front in both convex and non-convex regions. Two application examples are presented in this study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy, which permits the identification of Pareto optima from which the designer can choose the most adequate design balancing profitability and occupant comfort.

In this paper, we embed PBWE of tall buildings into RDO and tackle some difficulties when integrating them directly. We first formulate an integrated stiffness and vibration control RDO problem, and employ a frequency domain closed-form solution for uncertainty quantification and uncertainty propagation through the excitation-response-performance chain. Then we reveal the multi-objective optimization nature of RDO, and circumvent the difficulties in serviceability loss estimation by replacing scalar total cost with high-dimensional objective vector. Micro multi-objective particle swarm optimization in conjunction with kernel-learning based principle component analysis is employed to solve the corresponding many-objective problem with multiple probabilistic constraints and discrete design variables. The optimization results of CAARC benchmark indicate that we simplify risk-based PBWE of tall buildings from a complex multi-objective decision making process into a relatively easy multi-attribute decision making process.

The computer code is designed to get most of the inputs from the building model in SAP2000, to have minimal manual inputs that define diagrid shell geometry. The code is also built so that the engineer evaluates the optimum diagrid geometry for any rectangular plan building, which is modeled in SAP2000 software. Three different buildings, which consist of 30, 60, and 90 stories, are modeled in SAP2000 without diagrid shells on facades. Based on these models, the diagrid shell geometries are analyzed for both uniform angle (UA) and varying angle (VA) geometries. A different geometry approach to VA models is proposed, consisting of symmetry and continuum for the load distribution and asymmetry, achieving minimal weight. In order to evaluate the optimum VA topology, GA, is used. Predetermined dead, live, and wind loads are applied to the models based on minimum design loads according to American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7-10, with corresponding load factors to be able to get more realistic results. Based on the resultant module diagonal cross-sectional areas, an algorithm is developed and encoded in order to determine minimum required pipe section sizes according to buckling design of compression members as stated in American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 360-10, to give the engineer an approximate idea of what the required sections should be. Additionally, the feasibility of the optimum models is compared by complexity index parameters. The results of the analyses show that optimum VA models are more efficient than UA models concerning the diagrid shell's total weight.

Active tuned mass damper system is one of these devices, which is a combination of a passive tuned mass damper system and an actuator to produce a control force. The main objective of this paper is to present a practical procedure for both deterministic and probabilistic design of the active tuned mass damper control system using multi-objective genetic algorithms to mitigate high-rise building responses. For this purpose, extensive numerical analyses have been performed, and optimal robust results of the active tuned mass damper design parameters with their effectiveness in reducing the example building responses have been presented. Uncertainties, which may exist in the system, have been taken into account using a robust design optimization procedure. The stiffness matrix and damping ratio of the building are considered as uncertain random variables; and using the well-known beta distribution, 50 pairs of these variables are generated. This resulted in 50 buildings with different stiffness matrices and damping ratios. These simulated buildings are used to evaluate robust optimal values of the active tuned mass damper design parameters. Four non-commensurable objective functions, namely maximum displacement, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration of each floor of the building, and active control force produced by the actuator are considered, and a fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm approach is used to find a set of pareto-optimal solutions.

Furthermore, the conceptual design is combined with the optimization algorithm to play a guiding role in the optimization, and the surrogate model is built through support vector machine (SVM) to drive the optimization process with historical data and reduce the cost of the real model's evaluation.

Nevertheless, in current building practice, a lot of material is wasted, because load-bearing structures are often grossly overdimensioned. Numerical optimization tools have the potential to reduce the consumption of structural materials, but the lack of customized algorithms prohibits their use in daily design practice. This is because real-life structural optimization problems are complex, involving both discrete and continuous design variables as well as large numbers of building code constraints. In the literature, such problems are usually solved using metaheuristic (often genetic) algorithms, although gradient-based algorithms are better suited for continuous design variables. In this article, a new hybrid gradient-based/metaheuristic algorithm is proposed. It combines gradient-based and metaheuristic methods in a nested approach, exploiting the strengths of both: the ability to handle discrete design variables and fast convergence in terms of continuous design variables. The applicability and usefulness of the new hybrid algorithm is demonstrated in two realistic case studies to minimize the weight of the structure, taking into account all relevant design rules of Eurocode 3. Within identical computing time, the hybrid algorithm obtains significant material savings compared to a conventional genetic algorithm.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:34","2024-04-02 09:27:34","","","","","239","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112137","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Codes (standards); Structural optimization; Quadratic programming; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 5_Spatial (Roof); 7_Part of building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, although a number of methods have been proposed over the last 15 years for the system-level reliability-based design optimization of building systems subject to stochastic excitation, few have treated problems characterized by more than a handful of design variables. This limits their applicability to practical problems of interest, such as the design optimization of high-rise buildings. To overcome this limitation, a simulation-based method is proposed in this work that is capable of solving reliability-based design optimization problems characterized by high-dimensional design variable vectors while considering system-level performance constraints. The framework is based on approximately decoupling the reliability analysis from the optimization loop through the definition of a system-level subproblem that can be fully defined from the results of a single simulation carried out in the current design point.

In practice, the outrigger truss consists of triangular or Vierendeel types to stiffen tall buildings, and the decision of outrigger design has been qualitatively achieved by only engineers' experience and intuition, including information of structural behaviors, although outrigger shapes and the member's connectivity absolutely affect building stiffness, the input of material, construction ability and so on. Therefore the design of outrigger trusses needs to be measured and determined according to scientific proofs like reliable optimal design tools. In this study, at first the shape and connectivity of an outrigger truss system are visually evaluated by using a conceptual design tool of the classical topology optimization method, and then are quantitatively investigated with respect to a structural safety as stiffness, an economical aspect as material quantity, and construction characteristics as the number of member connection. Numerical applications are studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design process to generate a new shape and connectivity of the outrigger for both static and dynamic responses.

The feasibility of 3DP earth-based materials has been under investigation in recent years, with a particular focus on cob due to its favourable characteristics toward the 3DP process. Yet, there is a lack of definitive information on the construction of 3DP cob. Hence this paper investigates the structural feasibility of 3D-printed cob walls in low-rise buildings. The investigation involved experimental compression tests on 3DP cob samples to obtain key mechanical properties including the compressive strength and elastic modulus. These properties were then used as inputs for structural analyses with respect to three alternate types of 3DP cob wall patterns to evaluate their load-carrying capacity based on a limit-state design framework. Results from the analyses were implemented in modelling an idealised low-rise cob building covering a range of floor spans and wall heights. The analytical study found that 3D-printed walls have the potential to sustain gravity loads typical of residential construction. Further, since the 3DP material was shown to have similar mechanical performance to conventional (non-3DP) cob on the material scale, the 3D-printing process provides the opportunity to produce wall sections that are structurally more efficient than the solid section used in conventional cob construction. This results in lower material consumption, making 3DP cob attractive from the point of view of resource efficiency. An important outcome of the study is the demonstration of a model design technique for low-rise 3DP cob buildings that could be implemented as part of a broader optimisation procedure to satisfy structural and architectural design objectives.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:34","2024-04-02 09:27:34","","","","","301","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124079","Architectural design; Structural design; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Walls (structural partitions); Environmental impact; 3D printers; Compressive strength; Environmental technology; Compression testing; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 5_Others (1/2 stories, low rise)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using structural lateral system of super tall buildings as engineering background, the paper developed a practical fractional numerical optimization method (FNOM), which applies fractional strategy and quasi-constant assumption, to reduce material cost and embodied carbon cost by searching the optimal structural dimensions. Firstly, two kinds of relationships among optimization variables (structural dimensions), driven design constraints (the interstory drift and the natural period) and optimization objective (cost including material cost and embodied carbon cost) are mathematically modelled. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then introduced to search the optimal structural dimensions based on the quasi-constant assumption of virtual work and internal work of the inactive components. Thirdly, fractional strategy is applied to create assemblies composed of different structural component sets, and the assemblies are then to be optimized in proper sequences. Fourthly, FNOM is implemented as a user-friendly software called C-FNO to practically support the preliminary design of super-tall buildings. Finally, a 700 m high super-tall building is employed to illustrate FNOM by using C-FNO, and the results show that only three design constraints of the interstory drift, the natural period and the stress ratio need to be solved during each optimization step. Belt truss, mega column, outrigger truss and shear wall of the super tall building should be optimized in sequence to save more cost. A great amount of cost can be still saved for the super tall building with the normal traditional design.  2019","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:34","2024-04-02 09:27:34","","934-953","","","79","","Applied Mathematical Modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.10.067","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithms; Structural optimization; Numerical methods; Cost engineering; Trusses; C (programming language); 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cost minimization is a natural choice as the primary motivation for introducing the multi-objective performance based design concept in the earthquake engineering community was to reduce the observed unacceptable levels of damage costs in buildings for moderate intensity but more frequent earthquakes. This paper describes an approach to calculate the failure and life-cycle costs associated with different levels of damage and their consequences considering the random occurrences of seismic events and uncertainties in the calculated response. The inter-story drift is used as an effective response variable to define fragilities and failure costs, although it is realized that damage of some components may be better expressed in terms of the acceleration response. Since a life-cycle cost-based optimization methodology could be computationally demanding especially for yielding structures, the use a response spectrum method of analysis is considered for the response and failure cost calculations. Comparison of the numerical results, for three example buildings in Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston, obtained by the approximate response spectrum method and accurate time-stepping method utilizing an ensemble of base motions indicates that the response spectrum methods can provide a good estimate of the failure cost for a quick performance-based evaluation of different design alternatives.

This brings about new opportunities of collaboration between architects and engineers in the early stages of building design. The ease of testing alternatives by tweaking a set of parameters also opens the door for the application of generic optimization algorithms. Karamba is a finite element program geared towards interactive use in the parametric design environment GH. Being a GH plug-in, it seamlessly integrates with the diverse habitat of other third party programs available for GH. These range from building physics applications to genetic optimization engines. In the author's company, Karamba is used in early-stage design, form-finding, and structural optimization. ""White Noise"", a mobile exhibition pavilion for the Salzburg Biennale, serves as a case study that shows how Karamba can be used to optimize the structural performance of intricate building geometries.","2014","2024-04-02 09:27:33","2024-04-02 09:27:33","","217-221","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 95</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2749/101686614X13830790993483","Architectural design; Structural analysis; Optimization; Finite element method; Computer aided design; Algorithms; Computer programming; Finite element programs; Finite elements; Generic optimization algorithm; Geometry; Integrated planning; Integrated planning process; Inter active; Structural optimization; Parametric design; Structural; Parametric design environment; Parametric design tools; Visual programming environments; White noise; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 3_Stiffness; 7_Entire building; 6_Used cases; 6_Tool; 3_Others (num. connections); 3_Others (angles between neighbouring elements); 2_Others (aluminium); 5_Others (pavilion)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to account for the uncertainties in random wind excitation, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive and reliable dynamic optimisation technique in the time domain. The optimal lateral stiffness design problem of wind-excited tall buildings consists of (1) identifying the critical dynamic drift response in the time domain and (2) searching for the optimal distribution of element stiffness of the building subject to multiple drift design constraints. The critical time-history drift constraints of a wind-excited building are first treated by the worst-case formulation and then explicitly expressed in terms of element sizing variables using the principle of virtual work. The extreme value distribution and the Gaussian assumption are employed to formulate and simplify the probabilistic drift constraints, which are explicitly considered in the dynamic optimisation problem. The system reliability associated with the interstory drift is estimated approximately by the bound approach to ensure that the most cost-efficient solution also attains an acceptable reliability level.

Topology optimization problems utilize the firmest mathematical basis, to account for improved weight-to-stiffness ratio and perceived aesthetic appeal of specific structural forms, enabling the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) technique. Structural topology optimization is a technique for finding the optimum number, location and shape of “openings” within a given continuum subject to a series of loads and boundary conditions. Aerospace and automotive engineers routinely employ topology optimization and have reported significant structural performance gains as a result. Recently, designers of buildings and structures have also started investigating the use of topology optimization, for the design of efficient and aesthetically pleasing developments. This paper examines two examples of where topology optimization may be a useful design tool in civil/structural engineering in order to overcome the frontiers between civil engineers and engineers from other disciplines. The first example presents the optimized structural design of a geometrically complex high-rise structure and the optimal design of its architectural building shape. The second one focuses on the optimization and design of a perforated steel I-section beam, since such structural members are widely used nowadays in the vast majority of steel buildings and structures while they provide numerous advances. Conclusions are drawn regarding the potential benefits to the more widespread implementation of topology optimization within the civil/structural engineering industry. © 2015 JUST.

They are capable of resisting wind loads, but provide no support for the building structures to which they are attached. Although they are used to enclose many different types of modern building, and although they may be designed to carry any of the outward-facing materials an architect might wish to specify, the stereotypical curtain wall is a skyscraper's fully-glazed outer skin. The materials used in these wall systems, particularly their structural aluminium frames, are produced by energy intensive methods. Even though there is an environmental motive to reduce the embodied energy by minimizing aluminium content, and despite the obvious commercial incentive, it is a difficult mathematical challenge to find optimal extrusion shapes. The authors believe that because of the inherent complexity of the optimization task, in the curtain walls of real buildings, metal is used inefficiently. This paper describes the way in which near-optimal shapes for any particular building's curtain wall extrusions may be found using a parametrically-controlled geometric model in conjunction with a numerical search routine – in this case, a genetic algorithm. When the curtain walls designed for large and recently-constructed buildings by experienced facade engineers are compared with designs developed using the algorithmic techniques described herein, it is consistently the numerically-optimized solutions which are more efficient. The magnitude of the metal savings achieved by applying computational methods will vary from building to building, but this study suggests that in many cases aluminium mass may be reduced by 20% or more. © 2017 Institution of Structural Engineers","2017","2024-04-02 09:27:32","2024-04-02 09:27:32","","147-156","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2017.03.002","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind load; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Office buildings; Facades; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Building structure; Walls (structural partitions); Embodied energy; Green building; Green buildings; Facade design; Modern buildings; Aluminum; Curtain wall; Curtain-walls; Extruded aluminum; Extrusion; Cross-sectional shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting); 2_Others (aluminium); 7_Part of Building (Curtain wall)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a technique for the wind-resistant optimal design of supertall buildings with a complex structural system including concrete-filled steel tube columns, shear walls, and various types of beams and columns. In each optimal design cycle, the dynamic wind load acting on a building is transformed into a set of multiple-oriented equivalent static wind loads, which converts the optimal design for a building acted by dynamic loads into a simpler optimal design problem that considers only static loads. The objective function and constraint functions are explicitly formulated for various types of frame and area members, and consequently, the optimal design problem is mathematically modeled. The optimality criteria method is employed to seek a solution to the optimal design problem. A 68-story actual supertall building with a height of 303 m is considered for a case study. The obtained results show that the presented technique is capable of giving a good numerical optimal solution for practical use. The technique and results obtained from this study are valuable for academic and professional engineers involved in wind engineering and structural design.

Actually, this system is attracting especially for tall buildings, which may not be suitable for base isolation because large tensile forces exert on them. This paper aims to investigate the control effect of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings that are represented as bending-shear type models. An optimum design criterion integrating stability maximization criterion is developed for such a multi-degree-of-freedom TMD floor integrated high-rise building system. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem with the combination of the stability maximization criterion and H∞ or H2 criterion. Two series of numerical simulations, that is, the cases in which all the floors serve as TMDs and only a limited number of floors serve as TMDs, are conducted. The favorable performance of the proposed TMD floor system for high-rise buildings is demonstrated by comparisons with a fixed floor building equipped with additional high-damping devices achieving 10% first modal damping ratio under a various of seismic excitations. The TMD floor system is verified to have satisfying control effect, which can also solve the post-earthquake long-duration vibration problem of high-rise buildings observed in the 2011 great Tohoku earthquake.

This study proposes an optimal design method for minimizing the volume of the primary structural members (core wall, outrigger, and external columns) and calculating the optimal locations of outriggers using a genetic algorithm with the goal of efficiently controlling the lateral displacement of a high-rise building. The optimal solution of the outrigger system was determined based on the change in the number of stories (from one to four) at which outriggers were installed in a prototype model (a 400-m high-rise building). The results indicate that increasing the number of outrigger installations reduces the total volume of structural members needed in the outrigger system to satisfy the displacement constraint of the top floor (H/500, H: building height). Additionally, the cross-sections of the core wall and outrigger decreased and that of the external column increased, which indicated that the role of the external column in the control of lateral displacements increased as the number of outrigger installations increased. As a result, the contribution of the core wall to the bending moment decreased, which reduced the cross-section of the core wall. These results provide an optimal solution that considers the ideal locations of the outriggers and minimizes the volume of structural members within the maximum lateral displacement range, which is specified as a structural performance constraint.

In a shear-wall-based building, the conventional design process starts with an architect generating a floor plan, which is then passed to a structural engineer, who, based on knowledge and prior experience, tries to place shear walls to balance conflicting requirements: minimum structural weight, satisfactory structural strength and serviceability, conformity to architectural layout. This design process can be slow and inefficient, requiring a trial-and-error approach that is unlikely to lead to the best solution. The work presented in this paper intends to accelerate the process with an optimization system involving a ground structure program formulation, a modified evolutionary algorithm, and innovative computational techniques. Unlike existing work that focuses either exclusively on structural performance or architectural layout, this research integrates both. An efficient computational design methodology for shear wall layout in plan is introduced. The method minimizes structural weight with constraints on torsion, flexural strength, shear strength, drift, and openings and accessibility. It can be applied from the very beginning of floor plan design or after generating an architectural floor plan. This paper demonstrates the potential of this approach through a variety of case studies. Key contributions include a novel application of the ground structure method, a fast and robust modified evolutionary algorithm, and a simplified auto-calculation system for reinforced concrete design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-04-02 09:27:31","2024-04-02 09:27:31","","225-240","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 45</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.02.059","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Topology (interesting); 7_Part of building (Shear walls)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A seven-storey full-scale structure previously tested on shaking table was used as a reference. The optimal design parameters of the TMDs, i.e. damping and frequency ratios, were determined by using a genetic algorithm on a simplified model of the reference structure, composed by seven masses each representing one storey. The optimal solutions for the TMDs were then applied to a detailed finite element model of the seven-storey building, where the timber panels were modelled with shell elements and the steel connectors with linear spring. By comparing the numerical results of the building with and without multiple TMDs, the improvement in seismic response was assessed. Dynamic time-history analyses were carried out for a set of seven natural records, selected in accordance with Eurocode 8, on the simplified model, and for Kobe earthquake ground motion on the detailed model. Results in terms of acceleration reduction for different TMD configurations show that the behaviour of the seven-storey timber building can be significantly improved, especially at the upper storeys.

A real building scenario was used to test the proposed approach in the context of multi-storey reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Results show how the building life cycle performance is affected by the use of structurally optimised designs.

The novelty of the procedure includes three aspects. Firstly, the modal acceleration responses of buildings are employed to evaluate the occupant comfort in the building instead of the commonly used total acceleration responses. This enhances the applicability of the proposed method and reduces the computation error by including the effect of the reoccurrence period of wind and avoiding calculation of the peak factor of response. Secondly, because the current method such as the modified Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler (HLRF) algorithm is not suitable to the optimization design considering multiple wind directions, to overcome this problem, the design point method in generalized random space (DPG method) is used to establish equations of reliability for converting modal acceleration constraints to natural frequency constraints, in which an approach of mapping transformation is used to treat the non-normal variables. Thirdly, by improving the method of determining the limit of the wind speed based on the joint distribution of the wind speed and direction, the failure probabilities of modal accelerations under all wind directions are combined based on the joint probability distribution of the wind speed and direction to obtain the limit of natural frequency constraints. The parameters of the joint probability distribution are determined from the meteorological observation data of the wind speed. In association with the Optimality Criterion (OC) algorithm, the proposed method is applied in the wind resistant optimization of a 60-stories standard model of Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC). The investigations show that the proposed method can effectively decrease the structural total weight subject to reliability frequency constraints, displacement constraints and inter-story drift constrains. Considering the randomness of parameters and joint distribution of the wind speed and direction in the comfort constraint could enhance the design space for the structural total weight. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:30","2024-04-02 09:27:30","","460-471","","","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 28</p>","","","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence building structure design is a vital part in architecture design, architects often explore novel applications of their technologies for building structure innovation. However, such searches relied on experiences, expertise or gut feeling. In this paper, a new design method for the optimal building frame column design based on the genetic algorithm is proposed. First of all, in order to construct the optimal model of the building frame column, building units are divided into three categories in general: building bottom, main building and building roof. Secondly, the genetic algorithm is introduced to optimize the building frame column.

This benchmark building is a steel frame, accounting for nonlinear response via material non-linearity (bi-linear hysteresis) concentrated at the ends of moment-resisting beam-column joints, and is designed for the SAC PhaseIIISteel Project. In order to illustrate the real-world implementable optimal design approach for designing an optimal tuned impact damper system attached to practical complex structures, a reduced-order data-driven physical model is developed by using the response data specifically from finite element model and the optimization-based parameter identification algorithm. The reduced-order model has been iteratively constructed to be consistent favorably with the finite element model on the aspects of both modal frequencies and mode shapes. Based on the reduced-order model, the optimal parameters of the tuned impact damper system are subsequently designed by adopting proposed performance indices and the differential evolution algorithm conveniently. The optimal vibration control effects are evaluated by using the original finite element model structure with the optimal tuned impact damper. Such optimal performance is also compared with that of the original finite element model with a conventionally designed tuned impact damper system. The results show that the optimal designed tuned impact damper system not only can significantly mitigate the peak and root mean square values of dynamic displacements, but also can reduce effectively the number of plastic hinges of the nonlinear benchmark structure compared with that with the conventional design. Furthermore, the performance-based optimal design can lead to a better robust performance of the tuned impact damper system in the cases of the main structure subjected to unknown earthquake excitations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:30","2024-04-02 09:27:30","","314-327","","","160","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 44</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.01.042","Architectural design; optimization; Shape optimization; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; algorithm; Benchmarking; building; Damping; Data reduction; Differential evolution algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; finite element method; Finite element method; Impact damper; Iterative methods; Structural optimization; structural response; Parameter estimation; Particle damper; Particle dampers; Passive control; performance assessment; Performance-based optimal design; Reduced order models; Reduced-order model; seismic response; Structural panels; Tuned impact damper; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 1_Others (damper); 3_Others (damper parameter); 7_Building_Component (TID)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a minimum compliance optimization formulation, developed by other researchers, is applied to a framed-tube structure. The tube behavior is modeled as a cantilevered box beam. Independent variable in this problem is thickness of the box, and a formulation for its optimal value is proposed. The challenge in this research was treatment of the lower bound constraint on thickness in an analytical manner. To deal with this constraint, a critical height parameter is introduced, and the design domain is divided into two zones of constant thickness and constant curvature. This definition allows for computation of optimal thickness distribution along the structure through an analytic dimensionless equation. Most of the previously published papers in the field of tall structures are suitable for abstract analyses but not for design. In addition, most of them are computer-based. Considering these limitations, the current research presents a hand-calculation method for preliminary design, suitable for sensitivity analyses and parametric studies. As the presented formulations are dimensionless, they are applicable in any dimensional system. Different static loading patterns are considered; including the concentrated, uniform, triangular and quadratic forms.

Currently, steel reinforcement design is performed manually or semi-automatically using computer software such as ETABS, with reference to building codes. These approaches are time consuming and sometimes error-prone. Recent advances in building information modeling (BIM) technology allow digital 3D BIM models to be leveraged for supporting different types of engineering analyses such as structural engineering design. With the aid of BIM technology, steel reinforcement design could be automated for fast, economical and error-free procedures. This paper presents a BIM-based framework using the developed three-stage hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) for automated optimization of steel reinforcement in RC frames. The methodology framework determines the selection and alignment of steel reinforcement bars in an RC building frame for the minimum steel reinforcement area, considering longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive and shear steel reinforcement. The first two stages optimize the longitudinal tensile and longitudinal compressive steel reinforcement while the third stage optimizes the shear steel reinforcement. International design code (BS8110) and buildability constraints are considered in the developed optimization framework. A BIM model in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is then automatically created to visualize the optimized steel reinforcement design results in 3D thereby facilitating design communication and generation of construction detailing drawings. A three-storey RC building frame is analyzed to check the applicability of the developed framework and its improvement over current design approaches. The results show that the developed methodology framework can minimize the steel reinforcement area quickly and accurately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:29","2024-04-02 09:27:29","","39-57","","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 62</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.01.013","Architectural design; Automated optimization; Automation; Building codes; Building Information Model - BIM; Building information modeling; Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concrete reinforcements; Concretes; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Reinforced concrete; Information theory; Structural optimization; Reinforced concrete design; Metal drawing; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Industry foundation classes; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Optimization framework; Steel reinforcement; Steel reinforcement bars; Steel reinforcements; Intelligent buildings; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Topology (rebar in the cross-section); 1_Size (rebar-diameter)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since most of the structural material in a building exists within the floors, these present a significant opportunity for structural engineers to contribute to a more sustainable construction industry. This paper examines a novel flooring system of textile-reinforced concrete shells with a foamed concrete fill, which has the potential to halve the amount of materials in a building's entire structure. A new design and geometry optimisation method is described, as well as the construction and testing of two prototypes; each 18 mm thick, 2 m in span and 200 mm tall. These textile-reinforced concrete shells are unconventional in their low total depth, low reinforcement content and lack of rigid supports. Both were reinforced with AR-glass fibre textile and constructed using fine-grained concrete, however only one featured a foamed concrete fill. Each was tested to destruction under an asymmetric load. In both cases, a hinged collapse mechanism was formed rather than sudden catastrophic failure, with positive implications for safety and robustness. A non-linear finite element model was developed which replicated the observed behaviour well, including cracking patterns. Inaccuracies in geometry arising from the hand-made construction methods were measured and their structural impact was assessed and found to be small. The investigations confirm the strength, robustness and buildability of the structural system, and establish a reliable analysis method. © 2018 Institution of Structural Engineers","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:29","2024-04-02 09:27:29","","60-71","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 21</p>","","","Architectural design; Carbon; Concrete shells; Floors; Structural design; Reinforced concrete; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Low carbon; Shape optimisation; Textile reinforced concrete; Textile reinforced concretes; Textiles; Sustainable construction; Population statistics; Concrete testing; Design construction; Foamed concrete; Reinforced concrete shells; Shape-optimization; Structural testing; Thin shells; Well testing; 1_Shape; 2_Composite (Concrete, Steelrod); 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 6_Prototyping; 7_Building_Component (Floor slab)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The frames of these curtain walls are, usually, extruded aluminium – a material whose production is highly energy-intensive. Although means of enhancing the thermal performance of building envelopes have been scrutinized, comparatively little attention has been given to the cost and embodied energy savings that can be achieved through efficient structural design. No guidelines for efficient use of aluminium in a curtain wall have been published, and architects therefore have not known the impact that their decisions have upon the facade's material content. In this study more than 1000 unique curtain wall systems have been optimized numerically, each one to a different set of design criteria, and the results show the extent to which aluminium content is influenced by floor height, locations of supports, number of horizontal members per panel, width of the extrusions, spacing between mullions, design wind pressure, and the minimum allowable thickness of aluminium. The conditions in which the amount of metal required to construct a window wall (glazing spanning between two floors) might be less than that required for a curtain wall (an uninterrupted, multi-floor shroud), also have been explored. The results show that substantial metal savings – reductions of 40% or more – can be realized by making modest changes to the layout geometries and specifications that are in common use. The value of the corresponding construction cost reductions is significant: in the worldwide construction market, the potential savings are in billions of dollars per year. The practical steps that an architect and specifier should take in order to reduce metal content in a curtain wall are set out in a list. These savings are separate from, and in addition to, any that might be attained by optimizing the cross-sectional shapes of extrusion profiles. Unlike improvements in a facade's thermal performance, which usually require capital investment in insulating materials for returns that accrue over decades, material-efficient design methods are free to apply, and the benefits can be enjoyed immediately. © 2017 Institution of Structural Engineers","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:28","2024-04-02 09:27:28","","8-25","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 22</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2017.10.004","Architectural design; Floors; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Energy efficiency; Cost reduction; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Topology optimization; Wind effects; Walls (structural partitions); Embodied energy; Investments; Layout optimization; Green building; Green buildings; Technical specifications; Facade design; Topology optimisation; Aluminum; Curtain wall; Curtain-walls; Extruded aluminum; Extrusion; Large buildings; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting); 2_Others (aluminium); 7_Part of Building (Curtain wall)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This analysis model is applied to reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings, which comprise two heterogeneous materials—concrete and steel—that have different environmental impacts and thus have a high potential for CO2 emission mitigation. In the PBODS method presented in this study, CO2 emissions, material production costs, and the coefficient of variation (COV) of the inter-story drift ratio, which reflects the seismic performance, are set as the objective functions, and optimal designs that can minimize these three objective functions. The optimal designs for a 4-story and a 10-story RC buildings are then evaluated with respect to environmental sustainability, economic feasibility, and seismic performance using the presented integrated analysis model.

The FEA models, which account for nonlinear material properties of both timber and steel components, were validated against experimental results. The primary objective of this research was to optimise the connector geometry and material properties to achieve a target yield capacity of 85 kN. Considering a capacity-based design approach, where all the wood components remain elastic and only the steel tube deforms, a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the input-performance correlations. It was shown that the diameter (d) and thickness (t) of the tube, as well as the coupler diameter (c) were the main parameters influencing the yield capacity and overall performance of the connection. The subsequent optimisation resulted in an optimum detailing with d = 155 mm, t = 9.5 mm and c = 30 mm, and a required steel yield stress of approx. 800 MPa. With a load-carrying capacity of 98 kN, an elastic stiffness of 30 kN/mm, and a ductility of 9, the connection was deemed suitable for the design of resilient CLT buildings. Finally, it was shown that optimised detailing exhibited a robust performance in presence of uncertainties in the timber and steel material properties, as well as geometry of the detailing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:28","2024-04-02 09:27:28","","273-283","","","175","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 20</p>","","","Architectural design; optimization; Structural design; design; building; finite element method; Sensitivity analysis; structural component; timber; Timber; Wooden buildings; Laminating; Timber buildings; geometry; Performance; Timber structures; Resiliency; Yield stress; resilience; Capacity-based design; Cross laminated; ductility; Ductility; Finite element analyse; Hold-downs; Laminated timber; Tube connection; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Timber; 3_Stress (Force); 7_Building_Component (hold-down joint of CLT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three analysis models representing various tall buildings with outriggers were used to perform the optimum design of the outrigger, which is subject to the lateral displacement constraint. The results demonstrate that as the number of outriggers used was increased, the total volume of the outriggers decreased. However, the performance of the outriggers remained almost the same when the number of the outriggers was greater than two. The optimum locations of the outriggers were slightly higher than those from the analytical solutions with simplified assumptions.

Amongst structural materials, steel is characterised by its suitability to a large number of structures as well as a highly pollutant supply chain. Therefore, even a small reduction of the amount of steel currently used in building structures, would undoubtedly be beneficial towards the mitigation of environmental impacts. This paper presents a computational tool that aims to help practitioners to design material-efficient structures for multi-storey buildings frames. The tool is based on an optimisation framework, which –given a small set of input parameters defining the overall frame geometry and the system of loadings– seeks for optimised cross-sections for each structural member, based on a finite set of commercially available section profiles. Results are fully compliant with British and European standards for structural design. The user can therefore quickly and reliably assess a wide range of alternative frame layouts in a nearly real-time frame. To avoid misleading the decision-maker with very definite numbers, both structural mass and embodied carbon coefficients are considered along with their uncertainty through Montecarlo simulation. The final output consists of a probability density function of the embodied carbon for the specific structural design under consideration. The mathematical model which underpins the tool has been extensively validated. Results of an application to a practical example show a carbon emissions reduction potential of 23%. To maximise the impact of the research findings, the described work has been implemented into a plug-in tool for a widely used CAD software. This will help practitioners to take into account embodied carbon consideration early on in the design process when the room for improvement is greatest and the economic repercussions of design changes are low. This tool represents a fundamental first step to translate research on embodied carbon reduction into a means that is useful to, and usable by, industry professionals to mitigate building-related carbon emissions and progress towards national and international carbon targets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2018","2024-04-02 09:27:28","2024-04-02 09:27:28","","236-250","","","168","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 25</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.031","Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon; Embodied carbon; Embodied carbons; Optimisations; Design; Structural design; Computer aided design; Life cycle; Greenhouse gases; Decision making; Computational methods; Early stage; Emission control; Frame; GHG emission; GHG Emissions; Optimisation; Parametric; Probability density function; Steel; Supply chains; 3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Part of Building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New components are typically generated using numerical models validated by experiments, and the general methodology mainly consists of extensive numerical parametric studies. Since the basic geometrical shape is chosen beforehand, it is not possible to know if an optimum is reached. In view of this, topology optimization has emerged as a new design technique which offers much more design freedom. In this work, topology optimization is used to simultaneously improve the mechanical and heat transfer characteristics of building components. The first study shows that using a density-based method intermediate densities can constitute part of the optimized solution and the choice of certain parameters in the interpolation functions becomes influential. The second study presents a multi-material topology optimization approach in which an additional predefined material is added to the optimization problem. The results of both studies are compared. Finally, a practical case is optimized using this multi-material, multi-physics approach, and an optimized brickwork support bracket is found.

In this regard, three different structures are considered; 5-, 10-, and 15-story buildings. Seven mainshock–aftershock sequences are selected from the Iranian accelerogram database for analyzing the structures. By implementing an advanced two-step optimization method, buildings equipped with the active vibration control system (linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm) are designed to withstand all events of mainshock–aftershock sequences. In the first optimization step, a multi-objective optimization with the genetic algorithm is performed and a set of optimal Pareto front results is obtained. In the next step, the life-cycle cost of each optimal design sample of the Pareto front is calculated by considering the cumulative damage and the design sample with the minimum cost is selected as a final optimal property. The results prove that the active vibration control system is capable of reducing structural responses, including acceleration, drift, and residual drift under mainshock–aftershock sequences, and consequently the life-cycle cost of buildings, especially the taller ones. In addition, obtaining the building design variables (story stiffness and yielding force) and active LQR algorithm properties simultaneously leads to a slightly softer final building model than the conventional structure designed by the common building design code. Moreover, it is revealed that, by considering the aftershocks, the building life-cycle cost increases significantly. © The Author(s) 2018.","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:28","2024-04-02 09:27:28","","748-762","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 13</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077546318795533","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Earthquakes; Life cycle; Costs; Active control; Active vibration control systems; Aftershock sequence; Building performance; Control systems; Conventional structures; Integrated optimization; life-cycle cost; Multiobjective optimization; multi-objective optimization; Vibration control; Lifecycle costs; LQR algorithm; mainshock–aftershock sequence; Two-step optimizations; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stiffness; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 4_MOO (2); 3_Vibration; 1_Others (stiffness, ...)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to achieve this, we introduce a planning tool which interactively enforces checks for structural stability of the current design, and which on demand proposes how to stabilize it if necessary. Technically, our solution contains an interactive architectural modelling framework as well as a constrained optimization module where both are based on respective architectural rules. Using our tool, an architect can predict already in a very early planning stage whose designs are structurally sound such that later changes due to stability reasons can be prevented. We compare manually computed solutions with optimal results of our proposed automated design process in order to show how much our proposed system can help architects to improve the process of laying out structural models optimally. © 2016 The Authors Computer Graphics Forum © 2016 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2017","2024-04-02 09:27:28","2024-04-02 09:27:28","","80-94","","8","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 18</p>","","","Architectural design; Floors; Structural analysis; Structural design; Architectural floor plans; Architectural rules; Architecture; building planning; Building planning; Constrained optimization; Structural optimization; structural optimization; structural analysis; Stability; integrated architectural design; interactive design; Interactive design; Interactive planning; Load bearing walls; Modelling framework; Structural stabilities; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Topology (interesting); 3_Others (num. columns)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The structural efficiency of a gridshell is determined by its shape, which is traditionally designed using form-finding techniques. However, these techniques are primarily used to generate structures in pure tension or compression for a single load case only. In cases where classic form-finding techniques are not applicable, such as for cantilevering gridshells or simply supported gridshells, numerical optimization can be used to find a suitable shape. In this paper, an optimization procedure is proposed that optimizes the shape of a strained gridshell for a given grid. The forces applied to erect the gridshell are chosen as the design variables. These erection forces are optimized to minimize the so-called end-compliance, which is defined as the inner product of the external loads and the resulting displacements. The method of moving asymptotes is adopted to solve the optimization problem and implicit dynamic relaxation is used to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations. Geometric nonlinearity is taken into account by using co-rotational beam elements to model the gridshell laths. To validate the proposed approach, a 6×6 m2 prototype was built. The results show that this approach allows the structure to be optimized considering multiple load cases, while accounting for practical building constraints, and potential designer constraints. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:27","2024-04-02 09:27:27","","166-180","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 24</p>","","","Active bending; architectural design; bending; building construction; Co-rotational beams; construction method; Form finding; Form-finding; Geometric non-linearity; Method of moving asymptotes; Non-linear equilibrium equation; Nonlinear equations; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural design; structural component; Structural efficiencies; Numerical optimizations; Reticulated shell structure; shape; Strained gridshells; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 3_Stiffness; 7_Entire building; 5_Spatial; 2_Timber; 6_Prototyping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we propose three stochastic approaches to generating diverse and competitive designs. These approaches include (1) penalizing elemental sensitivities, (2) changing initial designs, and (3) integrating the genetic algorithm into the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are capable of producing a series of random designs, which possess not only high structural performance, but also distinctly different topologies.

In reality, however, upstream revisions are usually substantive: significant work in the schematic design and design development phases are due to resolving upstream issues. That said, within the conceptual design and initial phase, the process is mostly linear. This work presents a set of tools that move towards an integrated design optimization, where the building’s form and structure are optimized together and not as separate stages in the design.

In the optimization analysis, seven ground motions are scaled to three levels (corresponding to the service level, the design basis, and the maximum considered earthquakes, respectively) and the genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal pendulum parameters. The optimization results are compared with those obtained by the single-degree-of-freedom model, where significant difference is observed, showing the necessity of the presented study.

But in earthquake-prone areas, large-scale buildings mean higher risks; therefore improving the seismic capacity of buildings is an important measure to reduce the risk of buildings. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the isolation structure of buildings was introduced briefly, and the cost-benefit based optimization model of the isolation structure was constructed. The optimization of the isolation structure was carried out from the perspective of benefit analysis. Then, two buildings with the same structure were analyzed as examples. One kept the original isolation structure, and the other optimized the isolation structure with the optimization model. Findings: The final results showed that the optimized isolation structure had a lower input cost ratio, i.e. it had a higher benefit in the same whole life cycle, and the expected loss cost of the structure produced in the same life cycle was lower. Originality/value: In conclusion, the optimization model of the isolated structure based on benefit analysis can effectively improve the benefit of building isolation structure produced in the whole life cycle. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:27","2024-04-02 09:27:27","","461-469","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Shape optimization; Structural design; Benefit analysis; Building isolation; Building technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Earthquakes; Isolated structures; Isolation bearing; Isolation structures; Large scale buildings; Life cycle; Structural optimization; Risk assessment; Optimization design; Optimization modeling; Parameter optimization; Whole life cycles; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 3_Cost; 1_Others (damper); 2_Others (Not Specified); 7_Building_Component (damper)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The initial population evolves through series of crossover between current solutions (parent) followed by mutations generating new solutions to be adopted, for the next iteration, when they improve the performance criteria. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to a widely used type of reinforced concrete (RC) wall-slab system for which general structural rules are first elaborated prior to the genetic algorithm implementation.

Therefore, a holistic approach for energy-efficient design over the life cycle of buildings is necessary. In this work, the relationships between structural efficiency, energetic performance, and aesthetic design are explored in the context of tall buildings. The goal is to reduce the structural mass in order to reduce embodied energy while considering operational energy as well as the aesthetic expression of the structure. For this, we propose a framework that integrates code-based structural design of tall buildings with energy demand simulations, and perform a multiobjective optimization for a tall building in various climate zones. We show that structure can act as shading, that is, cooling savings are achieved with respect to a fully glazed building. Further, we illustrate the trade-offs between buildings with reduced mass, with comparatively little cooling savings, and heavier buildings, with increased cooling savings potential, for example, up to 50%. Finally, we discuss the impact of the column design in different climate zones. The resulting trade-offs allow the architect to make an informed decision between structural design and energy efficiency of the building without sacrificing the architectural intent. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:27","2024-04-02 09:27:27","","","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 7</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000355","Architectural design; Structural analysis; Structural design; Tall buildings; Life cycle; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy performance; Energy-efficient design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Holistic approach; Informed decision; Structural optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Operational energy; Savings potential; Structural efficiencies; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 4_MOO (2); 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 3_Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first method, the design response grammar, uses design rules—configurable by parameters—to develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the structural system under development. The second method, design via optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization) and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation, which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density distribution of each individual structural component, which can be regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case study, the study shows that—after optimization—the fronts remain the same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the generalization that is established in the first case study by using the found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the computational cost. As such it is concluded that the design response grammar is a promising support tool for the exploration and structural assessment of conceptual building spatial designs. Future research should focus on more types of structural elements; more objectives; new constraints to ensure feasible solutions, especially stress constraints; and the application of state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning to find more generalizations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:27","2024-04-02 09:27:27","","","","","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 14</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103009","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Conceptual design; Evolutionary algorithms; Structural optimization; Topology; Structural component; Structural elements; Design optimization; Approximation algorithms; Automated design; Building spatial design; Computational costs; Design grammar; Multi-disciplinary design; Optimization approach; Structural topology optimization; Pareto principle; Preliminary assessment; State-of-the-art techniques; Strain energy; Structural assessments; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 4_MOO (2); 3_Weight/Mass; 2_Others (Not Specified); 1_Topology (interesting, shape grammar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The superposition approach is shown to be applicable to the three primary load case problems involved. It is found that the optimal layouts identified differ from those obtained when bracing is sought for a pre-existing frame, already designed to resist gravity loads. A significant finding is that a parameter related to the difference in vertical and lateral loads to be applied in the applicable load cases is a key factor determining the optimal layout of frame members. Since applicable load cases are design code dependent, this also indicates that optimal layout will be strongly influenced by choice of design code.

A non-structural fill is included to provide a level top surface. Building on previous experimental and theoretical work, a complete design methodology is presented.

The results of this research provide valuable findings for the significant role of structural optimization in sustainable design of tall buildings as well as in limiting the use of construction materials.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-04-02 09:27:26","2024-04-02 09:27:26","","","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 37</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100730","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performance-based wind-resistant structural optimization can effectively reduce the material cost of supertall buildings in the premise of ensuring their structural safety and serviceability. For modern supertall buildings with complex structural systems, the formulation of its structural optimization problem is highly complicated. Moreover, the optimization problem itself is also nonlinear and extensive in scale. This study first addresses the optimization formulation of complex structure system which includes concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) frame members and shear wall members. These structural members are often used in supertall buildings but are seldom discussed in existing literature of structural optimization. Then, the interior point algorithm, which is propitious for large-scale nonlinear optimization, is used to seek the optimal design solution. A real-life supertall building, the 432 m Guangzhou West Tower, is used as an example to examine the effectiveness of the proposed computer-based optimization method. The proposed method is shown to work effectively in the optimal wind-resistant design of supertall buildings with complex structural systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:26","2024-04-02 09:27:26","","3493-3506","","6","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-020-02652-x","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization formulations; Structural optimization; Tall building; Complex structural system; Complex structure system; Concrete-filled steel tubes; Interior point algorithm; Large scale nonlinear optimization; Nonlinear programming; Optimization problems; Structural optimization problems; Tubular steel structures; Wind effect; Wind-resistant design; Wind effects; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Composite (CFST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It proposes to use an automatic prototype to perform the structural design, analysis and optimisation in a building information modelling (BIM)-based platform. This process starts with extracting the required information from the architectural model in Revit Autodesk, such as boundary conditions and designs different options of the structural models in Robot Autodesk. In this process, Dynamo for Revit is used to define the mathematical functions to use different variables and generate various structural models. The paper aims to expand the domain of automation in the BIM platform to reduce the iterative process in different areas such as conceptual structural design and collaboration between architects and structural engineers to reduce the time and cost at the early stages. Design/methodology/approach: The paper begins with an exploratory research by adopting a qualitative methodology and using open-ended questions to achieve more information about the phenomenon of automation and interoperability between structural engineers and architects and gain new insight into this area. Furthermore, correlation research is used by adopting quantitative and short questions to compare the proposed prototype with the traditional process of the structural design and optimisation and the interoperability between architects and engineers and consequently, validate the research. Findings: As an outcome of the research, a structural design optimisation (SDO) prototype was developed to semi-automate the structural design process of tall buildings at the early stages. Moreover, the proposed prototype can be used during the early stage of structural design in different areas such as residential buildings, bridges, truss, reinforced concrete detailing, etc. Moreover, comprehensive literature regarding using automation in structural design, optimisation process and interoperability between architects and engineers is conducted that provides a new insight to contribute to future research and development. Research limitations/implications: Due to the time limit, the paper results may lack in a comprehensive automatic structural design process. Therefore, the researchers are encouraged to expand the workability of the prototype for a comprehensive automatic design check such as automatic design for the minimum deflection, displacement of different types of buildings. Practical implications: The prototype includes implications for the development of different automatic designs. Originality/value: The focus of this paper is the optimisation of the structural design in the BIM platform by using automation. This combination is one of the novelties of this paper, and the existing literature has a very limited amount of information and similar work in this area, especially interoperability between architects and engineers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","149-169","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 10</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CI-11-2019-0126","Architectural design; Automation; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Iterative methods; Design/methodology/approach; Reinforced concrete; Building Information Modelling; Interoperability; Engineers; Structural optimization; Amount of information; Architectural modeling; Bridges; Functions; Integration; Machine design; Mathematical functions; Qualitative methodologies; Research and development; Residential building; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 5_Multistory (1,2 stories)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces a wind-resistant optimal design method of supertall buildings based on HFFB wind tunnel experiments. Based on the HFFB wind tunnel test and wind-induced vibration analysis, it provides a reliable and efficient method for structural optimization of supertall buildings with different types of structural members and multiple constraints. Taking advantage of the classic linear mode shape assumption of the HFFB technique, this paper also presents an alternative routine that transforms all different types of constraints into a uniform frequency constraint, which significantly reduces the computational intensity while still offers acceptable accuracy of optimization results. Moreover, the sensitivity of the optimization results to the adopted basic wind pressure value is discussed. The total material cost of the optimized structure increases exponentially with the increase of the basic wind pressure, indicating that the structural costs of supertall buildings are quite sensitive to the adopted basic wind pressure for structural design and its value should be precisely determined by the wind climate analysis of the construction site. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","","","","248","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 9</p>","","","architectural design; multistorey building; Cost benefit analysis; HFFB; High frequency force balances; Mathematical transformations; Optimal design methods; Optimisations; optimization; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Tall buildings; Wind stress; Wind tunnel test; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Super tall buildings; Tall building; vibration; Vibration analysis; Vibrations analysis; Wind induced vibrations; Wind pressures; wind stress; wind tunnel; Wind tunnel experiment; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Composite (CFST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These applications have shown successful response reduction performance for tall buildings. The important dynamic responses of building structures with the IIS are the peak intermediate isolator drift (IID), and the peak inter-story drift (ISD). The semi-active intermediate isolation system (SAIIS) was developed to more effectively reduce these seismic responses. In previous study, the authors showed that the SAIIS using magnetorheological dampers successfully reduced both the IID and the ISD. However, the optimal design of the SAIIS only was conducted, without considering the building structure. If both the SAIIS and the building structure properties are considered in the optimal design procedure, more effective optimal design for both the SAIIS and the building structure can be achieved. In this research, a simultaneous multi-objective optimization (MOO) method of the SAIIS and the building structure is proposed to achieve this. Genetic algorithm was selected for simultaneous MOO of the SAIIS and the building structure. The fuzzy inference controller was selected as a control algorithm. The authors show that in comparison to the sequential optimization procedure that practical applications generally use, the simultaneous MOO method can provide much better control capacity and structural design process. © 2021, Korean Society of Steel Construction.","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","604-612","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 3</p>","","","Architectural design; Optimal design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; Genetic algorithms; Interstory drifts; High rise building; Building structure; Fuzzy inference; Inference engines; Isolation systems; Magneto-rheological dampers; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Response reductions; Seismic response; Seismic response reduction; Semi-active intermediate isolation system; Sequential optimization; Simultaneous structural optimization; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stiffness; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Others (damper); 1_Others (stiffness, ...); 2_Others (Not Specified); 3_Stiffness (Story drift); 3_Others (damper parameter); 3_Vibration (damping); 3_Stiffness (isolator drift); 4_MOO (5)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this goal, careful assessment of risk from future hazards is required. In practice, the risk to building structures is regulated by structural design codes through target reliability levels, which are reflected in many code factors, including partial safety factors, load combination factors, and modification factors. Optimizing the target reliability levels often requires running a large number of nonlinear dynamic analyses of complex finite element models, which imposes a significant burden on the computational resources. Computation time can be reduced considerably by employing surrogate models that can efficiently approximate the relation between input design and hazard intensity variables with building response output. This paper explores the different surrogate models, namely, support vector machines, kriging, and neural networks, for structural response prediction of a building class so that they can be used in the target reliability index optimization of a building class (a group of buildings with the same load-carrying characteristics). The uniqueness of this study is in developing a single surrogate model for a group of buildings instead of a single building design. The investigation on the performance of the surrogate models in structural response prediction is conducted for mid-rise office building class by comparing the computation time, accuracy, and robustness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 6</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.102041","Architectural design; Reliability; Structural design; Hazards; Seismic design; Office buildings; Forecasting; Building class; Computational resources; Load combination factors; Load-carrying characteristics; Modification factors; Partial safety factor; Risk assessment; Safety factor; Seismic response estimation; Steel moment-resisting frame; Structural design codes; Structural response prediction; Support vector machines; Surrogate model; Target reliability index; Target reliability index optimization; Seismic response; Structural frames; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Others (target reliability index)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional displacement-based design is limited to simple displacement targets, with optimization techniques (GA), it is feasibly to consider more performance chrematistics (e.g. costs, serviceability, etc.). By formulating drift targets and other structural design limit states within an elimination step of the GA optimization process, the method proposed here optimizes rocking wall design with multiple criteria that factor much more than lateral displacement targets in the seismic analysis. This type of optimization is difficult to perform using traditional manual trial-and-error approaches. An existing simplified nonlinear time-history simulation model (validated through full-scale shake table test data) of a wood rocking wall is employed in this process. The design for an example building in Seattle with a six-story rocking wall is presented using the proposed procedure. The results revealed that the optimization of the mass timber rocking wall lateral system can be achieved in a reasonable time frame using the proposed method. Even though the same drift limits were applied, final designs produced by GA varied, depending on the other optimization objectives. This demonstrates how the seismic design of wood rocking wall systems could be readily improved with computerized optimization tools that factor in other aspects of the design including cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","","","","229","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111603","1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 1_Topology; 6_Case study; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Timber; 7_Part of Building (Lateral system); 3_Vibration (acceleration)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, SSI is rarely considered in the design of building structures, and instead, buildings are frequently analyzed using a rigid base assumption and quasi-static loading conditions that ignore SSI and its dynamic nature. Acknowledging these shortcomings, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published in 2012 a set of recommendations on time-domain analyses of SSI for building structures compatible with standard finite element packages for consideration in engineering design. The so-called NIST GCR 12-917-21 report introduced a major simplification to enable frequency domain tools to be implemented in time domain analyses. That is, replacing the frequency-dependent soil impedance functions by a single-valued functions read at the flexible-base structure frequency; This work seeks to quantify the accuracy of this simplification considering fully coupled two-dimensional (2D) finite element models (FEM) as the reference. Using a Bayesian approach based on ensemble Kalman inversion (EnKI) and a range of numerical simulations of soil–foundation–building interaction, we estimate the optimal frequency that can be used to estimate soil impedance for time domain analyses; and we evaluate the improvement that the corresponding impedance offers relative to the full FEM results when compared to time domain analyses performed in accordance to the NIST recommendations outlined above. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:25","2024-04-02 09:27:25","","1955-1979","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/8755293020981994","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 3_Vibration (natural period); 1_Others (natural period)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In previous work, a database of 165 Chilean residential projects of reinforced shear wall concrete buildings was built, which fed a regressive neural network model to predict the wall's engineering thickness and length values from an architectural 30-feature input vector, which accounts for geometric and topological properties, archiving remarkable results regarding the coefficient of determination (R2). However, a regressive model of this nature does not incorporate a spatial detail or contextual information of each wall's perimeter, and also, the prediction of other parameters such as the wall translation has a poor performance. For this reason, the present research proposes a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models to generate the final engineering floor plan by combining two independent floor plan predictions, considering the architectural data as input. The first plan prediction is assembled using two regressive models that predict the wall engineering values of the thickness, the length, the wall translation on both axes from the architectural plan, and the floor bounding box width and aspect ratio. The second plan prediction is assembled using a model that generates a likely image of each wall's engineering floor plan. Both independently predicted plans are combined to lead the final engineering floor plan, which allows predicting the wall's rectangles design parameters and propose new structural elements not present in architecture, making the methodology an excellent candidate to accelerate the building wall layout's early conceptual design. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:24","2024-04-02 09:27:24","","","","","239","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 31</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112311","5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 3_Others (not readable); 7_Part of building (Shear walls); 4_Others (not readable); 1_Topology (ML)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subproblems are iteratively solved instead of the original problem. The substructures are analysed and optimally designed, one after another, until convergence, taking into account the effects of other parts of the building to maintain the building’s integrity. Thus, the analysis of a high-rise building is accomplished by analysing a set of low-rise building substructures. Concurrently, the high-dimensional optimization problem is solved through some low-dimensional subproblems. Therefore, building analysis, design and optimization are conducted simultaneously. To demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the approach, examples from the literature aresolved. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:24","2024-04-02 09:27:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","","Architectural design; Optimal systems; Structural design; Tall buildings; High rise building; Structural optimization; Optimization problems; Steel frame; Minimum weight; Metaheuristic; high-dimensional problem; High-dimensional problems; Higher-dimensional problems; meta-heuristics; minimum weight; Reaction deformation transmission; size optimization; Size optimization; steel frame; Sub-problems; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FPA is characterised by simplicity in its formulation as well as high computational performance and it has been found to outperform other well-established algorithms in a range of diverse optimization problems. The present study applies, for first time, the FPA to the computationally challenging optimum design of real-world 3D reinforced concrete (RC) building frame structures after a set of appropriate modifications to its original formulation. To serve this goal, a new computationally efficient framework for the optimum design of 3D RC frames is developed that is interacting with the well-known software SAP2000 for the purposes of structural analysis and design. The framework is then applied to the minimum material cost design of a 4-storey and a 12-storey RC building in accordance with Eurocode regulations. It is found that the FPA exhibits better or similar computational performance than other well-established algorithms in these optimization tasks. Furthermore, parameter tuning analysis reveals the FPA parameter values that maximize its computational performance in the optimum structural design of 3D RC building frames. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:24","2024-04-02 09:27:24","","","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 15</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102935","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Structural analysis; Structural design; Building frames; Computational efficiency; Computational performance; Flower pollination algorithm; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Reinforced concrete; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; Reinforced concrete buildings; Parameter estimation; Optimum designs; Parameter tuning; Parameters tuning; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, rebar design is performed at the individual member level with few considerations of the interference between different intersecting members, leading to potential clashes and buildability issues. Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) is a cutting-edge technology concept that improves the design for higher buildability by incorporating knowledge from downstream manufacture and assembly activities into the early design phase. This paper presents an innovative DfMA-oriented approach for rebar design optimization with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm. Firstly, activities related to the manufacture and assembly of rebar are identified to apply DfMA principles, followed by the proposed BIM-based optimization framework. Secondly, multi-objective cost design formulation including both the material cost and the installation cost is proposed, incorporating the design code requirements and DfMA considerations. Following this, key modules for implementation are presented including the rebar layout searching, the hybrid genetic algorithm incorporated with Hooke and Jeeves's method for optimization and rebar clash avoidance. The illustrative example shows that the proposed approach can generate a series of practical rebar layouts, and a trade-off between the material cost and installation cost is found, which means excessive emphasis on minimizing one of them will lead to the rise of the other. © 2021","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:24","2024-04-02 09:27:24","","","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 11</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103310","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Optimisations; Structural design; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Economic and social effects; Reinforced concrete; Building Information Modelling; Information theory; Machine design; Design optimization; Steel reinforcements; Manufacture; Design for manufacturability; Design for manufacture and assemblies; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Concrete structure; Design for manufacture and assembly; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Material cost; Metaheuristic algorithm; Rebar design; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 1_Topology (rebar in the cross-section)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This also stands for the design of supplemental dissipation devices such as multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs). Although MTMDs present several advantages over conventional TMDs, their design is a rather complex process. Thus, an efficient optimization algorithm is necessary to design large-scale MTMDs. This paper presents a powerful multi-hazard optimization-based methodology for the design of MTMDs attached to tall buildings. The total added mass is minimized, while the multi-hazard life-cycle cost (LCC) is taken as a constraint. To enable an efficient optimization of large-scale MTMDs, a gradient-based algorithm is developed, supported by a sensitivity analysis of the PEER-based multi-hazard LCC formulation. Material interpolation techniques are used to provide distinct design alternatives. The methodology is applied to a realistic tall building. First, a small-scale problem is used to compare the new methodology with classic evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework required less than 2% of the function evaluations executed by the benchmark algorithms to deliver competitive solutions. Subsequently, large-scale problems using different formulations are presented. Solving problems with 133 TMDs, the optimized solutions allow to reduce the multi-hazard LCC by 35%, adding 0.69–0.86% of the building mass. The results show that the algorithm can provide economic designs at acceptable computational costs, and the methodology can capture consistently the multi-hazard behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:24","2024-04-02 09:27:24","","","","","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","","","Architectural design; Structural design; Tall buildings; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Life cycle; Costs; Design alternatives; Gradient based algorithm; Hazards; Interpolation techniques; Life cycle costs (LCC); Life-cycle cost optimization; Multi hazard approach; Multi-hazard optimization; Seismic design; Sensitivity analysis; Multiple tuned mass dampers; Optimized solutions; Tuned mass dampers; Wind design; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 1_Others (damper); 3_Others (damper mass); 7_Building_Component (TMD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a CRSBF, post-tensioned (PT) strands and shear fuses are the distinct features providing the self-centering and energy dissipation mechanisms. As a relatively new structural system, there is a need to study this system’s optimal design. Control co-design has gained interest in recent years as a class of integrated engineering system design methods as an alternative to the traditional approach of optimizing the structural design and sequentially optimizing the control system’s design. It considers the direct relationship between physical and control system design decisions to discover non-obvious design solutions that enable new performance and functionality levels. This paper proposes a performance-based control co-design methodology for building structures integrating CRSBFs that concurrently minimizes the mainframe weight and determines the CRSBF design parameters subject to design code requirements as the optimization constraints. The patented neural dynamic model of Adeli and Park is used in this research to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. The seismic performance evaluation of the proposed methodology includes a shear frame and a nonlinear 6-story 3D building structure. The 6-story building model consists of 282 nodes with 1,692 degrees of freedom. A total of 610 frame elements, 8 PT strands with nonlinear material, and 32 nonlinear links are determined without requiring high-performance computing. Results show that the energy dissipation mechanism effectively reduces the seismic demand in structural members. The proposed performance-based control co-design methodology can lead to 21% reduction in the total weight of the 6-story frame structure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2024-04-02 09:27:23","2024-04-02 09:27:23","","1111-1125","","3","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-021-02902-6","Architectural design; Structural design; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Seismic design; Control systems; Nonlinear programming; Seismology; Structural frames; Co-design methodology; Control co-design; Controlled rocking steel braced frame; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Energy dissipation; Energy dissipation mechanism; High performance computing; Integrated engineering; Neural dynamic model; Non-linear optimization problems; Performance-based design; Seismic performance evaluation; Shear fuse; Steel braced frames; Systems analysis; Traditional approaches; Parks; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Building Component (brace device)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, Structural Optimization (SO) has received a lot of attention in the construction industry to reduce material and to enhance structural performance. However, the lack of communication between structural engineer and architect is a well-known problem discussed in the literature. This can lead to inefficient projects, thus increasing cost and time. The purpose of this work, thus, is to understand how SO can be inserted in a BIM project, specifically analysing the information exchanges between architects and structural engineers, to mitigate the problem related to lack of communication. The investigation included a systematic literature review to comprehend the current scientific scenario in these areas. It identified that there is still a research gap related to the adoption of SO to facilitate the communication between architects and structural engineers in a BIM environment. To help answer this question, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) structure was developed which maps the information flow to connect architects and engineers through SO in a BIM environment, aiming to optimize the information exchanges. By applying the methodology to three experiments of increasing complexity, the proposed framework proved to improve the collaboration issue beyond other project benefits, such as reduction of material consumption, improvement of sustainability indexes, and structural performance. Thus, the main finding of this study is that the connection between BIM and SO can improve the collaboration between these two players in the early design stages and, thus, it can potentially lead to a more efficient design process. More studies are still necessary to solve technological barriers related to software interoperability. © 2022 The author(s).","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:23","2024-04-02 09:27:23","","223-239","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.36680/j.itcon.2022.011","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; structural engineering; architecture; Building Information Modelling; Engineers; Structural engineer; Construction industry; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization; structural optimization; Sustainable development; Structural performance; BIM; Information exchanges; In-buildings; Information dissemination; Architects/engineers; information exchanges; lack of communication; Lack of communication; Model programs; Modeling environments; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 3_Stiffness; 3_Stress; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 2_Others (ABS Plastic); 1_Topology; 5_Others (Single story house); 6_Case study; 7_Entire building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimal buildings are obtained through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) multi-objective technique. Unlike most of this type of studies, the complete design of the 3D frames will be obtained considering the slabs, beams, columns, and braces as variables of the algorithm that are used to calculate dead and seismic loads. For this aim, two objective functions are established: (1) the first objective function is the cost of the structural building that includes materials and construction; (2) the second is the ratio between the maximum inter-story drift and the allowable drift, which is the most common structural performance parameter used by the earthquake building codes. For the purpose of this study, several R/C buildings are designed in accordance with the Mexico City Building Code (MCBC) using NSGA-II. The results demonstrate that as the height of the R/C buildings tend to increase, the frames with BRBs are more economical having similar level of structural performance in comparison with traditional moment resisting R/C framed buildings.

According to the characteristics of comprehensive perception and intelligent processing of the Internet of Things, a reverse suspension structure design model is constructed based on the finite element method and simulated annealing algorithm. Besides, deep learning is adopted to train complex functions for performance correction and to optimize the plane structure of shell structure. Moreover, the force is transformed into shape, and the form-finding process is completed to facilitate the operation of designers. Finally, the spatial anchoring ability of the geographic information system is used to match and calculate the relevant characteristics of spatial elements. On this basis, the index construction strategy based on weight distribution is employed to realize the data fusion diagnosis framework and enhance the intelligence of architectural design. The simulation results show that the maximum tensile stress of the physical suspension experiment is 3.71 MPa and the maximum compressive stress is 14.7 MPa. The compressive stress value is much larger than the tensile stress value. The maximum deformation value's difference between the compressive and tensile stress is 0.07 and 0.11, respectively. The error is within the acceptable range, which is similar to the compression state results obtained from the actual suspension physical experiment, indicating that the initial design model of the reverse suspension structure based on deep learning is reliable. In addition, the evolutionary optimization effect analysis results demonstrate that the load of the design structure is relatively uniform, which verifies the feasibility of the algorithm reported here. The research significance of the reverse suspension structure model constructed here is to provide an accurate and feasible design idea for the reverse design of some complex structures in the building suspension. It can also shorten the creation and improvement cycle of this kind of structure and optimize the performance and construction cycle of the building structure. © 2022 Xiwen Yu et al.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:23","2024-04-02 09:27:23","","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7544113","Architectural design; Structural design; Algorithms; Building structure; computer simulation; Computer Simulation; Deep learning; Data fusion; Performance; Design efficiency; Structure design; Design models; Materials design; Compressive stress; Deep Learning; Design programs; finite element analysis; Finite Element Analysis; Implementation and optimization; Simulated annealing; Stress values; Suspension structure; Suspensions (components); Tensile stress; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 6_Methodology; 3_StrainEnergy; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 5_Spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, structural optimization processes combined with shape grammar constitute an important tool to support the design phase of large scale structures. This paper proposes shape grammars for the topology optimization of grid shells and diagrid tall buildings characterized by triangulated patterns, with the aim to minimize the structural weight. The structural feasibility of the generated solutions is assessed through numerical analyses, while the optimized patterns are identified by means of optimization processes based on genetic algorithm. The results are provided in terms of optimal geometrical patterns, structural weight, stiffness/strength checks. The approach is helpful to support the investigation of lightweight structural patterns and structurally efficient solutions.

Based on CEN TC350, life cycle assessment (LCA) indicators, and EN standards, the life cycle assessment of a building should be conducted in the initial steps of the design process. The main target of this study is related to the sustainability evaluation of the optimized structural designs by the various lateral force-resisting system to select the best structural system for a tall building. According to interviews with 28 experts, condition and location of the study area, and intensive observation, 12 lateral force resisting systems were proposed to design a 17-storey five-bay structure. Each structural design was optimized by the optimization modules of SAP2000. Eleven indicators were selected based on data availability, experts' opinions, and authors' opinions. The weight and effect value (EV) of changes intensity were calculated based on interviewing experts. The values of the indicators were calculated using an indirect and direct manner based on SAP2000 results. A technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach was employed for integrating the values of the proposed indicators. Moreover, an applied effect of changes intensity in each indicator (AECIEI) method, which is one of the simplified MCDA approaches, was utilized to evaluate the sustainability of all scenarios. After sorting all scenarios based on TOPSIS and AECIEI, the results of these methods were compared. The results show that AECIEI can apply the effect of changes intensity and critical indicator on sustainability evaluation; thus, its results are more accurate than the results of TOPSIS. The combination of the steel moment frame and the special reinforced concrete shear wall in both directions was chosen as the best optimized structure based on AECIEI's results. This scenario with sustainable value (SV) of 0.014 was selected as the best option with respect to ductility with a value of 4.17 and the emitted air pollution with a value of 20.40 Ton. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:23","2024-04-02 09:27:23","","","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00482","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization; Life cycle; Ecodesign; Reinforced concrete; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Lateral force resisting system; Availability; Environmental issues; Applied effect; Change intensity; Changes intensity; Ideal solutions; Sap2000; Social and environmental; Social issues; Sustainability evaluations; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, diagrid structural systems became a current trend in tubular mid- and high-rise building structures for their significant lateral stiffness and aesthetic potential. Their unique geometric configuration allows the efficient distribution of internal forces that lead to optimal structural designs. However, existing design codes and provisions do not provide specific guidelines for their design under earthquake and wind loading. For this reason, this paper studies the properties of steel diagrid structures, including optimal diagrid angle, diagrid density, and fundamental period, as a function of geometric parameters. This study uses a large set of structural models with aspect ratios (H/B) from 1 to 4, diagrid angles (θ) between 45° and 90°, and diagrid densities (ρd) between 3 and 12. The structural design of each model is obtained using a soft-computing optimization algorithm, denominated hybrid counter propagation neural dynamic (CPND) model, that determines member sizes from a database of commercially available W-shapes following ASCE 7-16 standard and AISC-15 steel construction manual. This investigation confirms that the optimal diagrid angle increases with height, highlights the importance of diagrid density in structural design, and demonstrates the effect of the diagrid angle on the fundamental period. A new set of equations are proposed for: (1) the optimal diagrid angle as a function of height, and (2) the fundamental period of diagrid structures as a function of angle and height. The proposed equations allow the estimation of structural properties for the design of steel diagrid structures.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:22","2024-04-02 09:27:22","","","","3","148","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0003271","Architectural design; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization; Fundamental period; Structural optimization; Aspect ratio; Structural systems; Design optimization; 'current; Diagrid angle; Diagrid structure; Dynamics models; Natural hazard; Neural dynamics; Soft computing; Structural properties; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 7_Entire building; 3_Weight/Mass; 1_Shape (interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To simultaneously minimize the construction cost and the environmental impact, a green design model for PC slabs in long-span structures is necessary. In this paper, a multi-objective green design model for prestressed concrete slabs (MGDPCS) was developed to minimize both CO2 emissions and the construction costs of PC slabs. MGDPCS provides the optimized PC slab thickness, diameter and yield strength of the rebar, size and yield strength of the tendon using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for the input PC slab size and load. Furthermore, the effects of changes in the long- and short-side of span and tendons of PC slabs on construction costs and environmental impact are analyzed using the proposed model. Accordingly, we developed two indicators, that is, the environmental and economic scores and the eco-friendly coefficient, to evaluate the performance of the practical green designs using MGDPCS. To verify the applicability of MGDPCS, the model was applied used to analyze the designs of PC slabs in an actual six-story industrial building with a slab span of 10 m × 10 m.

However, the senior engineers can be biased towards solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process; however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types) to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this article, we present the development and validation of a genetic algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional conceptual design process.

Design/methodology/approach: This framework relies on a computationally efficient approximation of the constraint and objective functions using a radial basis function model with a linear tail, also called the combined response surface methodology (RSM) in this article. Considering both the code-stipulated constraints and other construction requirements, three sub-optimization problems were constructed based on the relaxation model of the original problem, and then the structural weight could be automatically minimized under multiple constraints and loading scenarios. After modulization, the obtained results could meet the discretization requirements. By integrating the commercially available ETABS, a dedicated optimization software program with an independent interface was developed and details for practical software development were also presented in this paper. Findings: The proposed framework was used to optimize different high-rise concrete buildings, and case studies showed that material usage could be saved by up to 12.8% compared to the conventional design, and the over-limit constraints could be adjusted, which proved the feasibility and effectiveness. Originality/value: This methodology can therefore be applied by engineers to explore the optimal distribution of dimensions for high-rise buildings and to reduce material usage for a more sustainable design. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:21","2024-04-02 09:27:21","","2256-2283","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EC-08-2021-0473","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Structural design; Tall buildings; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Discrete optimization; Radial basis function networks; Optimization methodology; Surface properties; Software design; Response surface; High rise; Discrete sizing optimization; High-rise concrete building; High-rise concrete buildings; Multiple loading; Multiple loading scenario; Multiple loading scenarios; Sizing optimization; Material usage; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, cost design optimization was performed for buildings with three different floor systems: flat plates (FS), flat slabs with drop panels (FSDP), and solid slabs (SS). The evolutionary method provided by the Excel solver was used as the optimization algorithm because it can deal with the complex nature of structural design problems. The objective function was the total construction cost of the building, including the costs of concrete, reinforcement bars, labor, and formwork, while still fulfilling the constraints of the Egyptian code of practice (ECP-18). The applicability of the presented algorithm was investigated in a design example, where the tuning of the evolutionary algorithm control parameters was sought, and the best parameters were investigated. Two case studies were employed to study the impacts of changing the column spacing and concrete grades on the optimal cost for each floor system. The results showed that low concrete grades, (i.e., characteristic strength up to 40 MPa) and column spacings up to 5 m are preferred in terms of direct construction costs for low-rise RC residential buildings. © 2022 by the authors.

They also considered one of the major energy consumers with little regards to sustainability. Tall building is wind-sensitive structure and shape plays major role in determining wind loads, which usually govern the design of its lateral resisting system. Thus, evaluating wind loads properly and designing an optimal lateral system accordingly are the main challenges attributed to the design process of irregular tall building. This paper presents a computational procedure for the optimal design of wind-resistant irregular tall building to minimize the total weight of structure within design requirements in single digital environment. That is achieved firstly by creating a digital system of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis that is coupled with pressure-load translation (PLT) algorithm to evaluate the wind motions on irregular tall buildings and generate the design wind loads accordingly. Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enhance design constrains function of lateral displacements, inter-story drifts and top acceleration is then developed to perform structural optimization. A numerical example using 70-story twisting reinforced concrete building is implemented to verify the feasibility of the developed computational procedures. Steady and incompressible flow applied at ((Formula presented.)) angle of attack was implemented in the CFD model to simulate the wind flow on the studied building. Genetic algorithm with improved design constraints of static and dynamic design requirements was developed to optimize the structure effectively and efficiently. The numerical example demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving 35.71% reduction of concrete volume from the original lateral structural system design. This is also translated into a sustainability value by lessening the embedded carbon dioxide by 4,400 tons.

As a relatively new structural solution, there is a need to study modular buildings' optimal design. In this regard, previous studies focused only on employing optimisation techniques at the member level to enhance the structural capacity of steel beams in modular building systems (MBS). This paper explores the applicability and effectiveness of an optimality criteria (OC)-based minimum-weight design method in reducing self-weight of MBS while maintaining their overall lateral stiffness measured by natural frequency. This is achieved by pursuing an innovative optimisation investigation involving a three-storey, standalone MBS with hinged inter-module joints, together with a comparative moment-resisting frame (MRF) benchmark structure with two different beam-column connection rigidities. Continuous-valued sizing optimisation of two structural systems under a single frequency constraint is achieved through a novel, numerically stable, iterative OC algorithm. The latter is developed from frequency-related OC formulated rigorously through the Lagrange multiplier approach. The discrete minimum-weight design is supported by a mapping strategy designed to round the continuous optimum to the most economical standard steel sections. Pertinent numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve significant steel savings for the adopted MBS without compromising its modal stiffnesses. Further, it is found that the MRF structure with semi-rigid connections can meet the same target frequencies with slightly smaller steel tonnages. It is envisioned that this study will pave the way towards achieving more resilient and cost-effective modular units and tall modular buildings that further support the building industry in meeting its goals of construction efficiency and sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:21","2024-04-02 09:27:21","","","","","251","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 12</p>","","","4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient structural components could result in building weight reductions, leading to material savings and a reduced carbon footprint. Shaping of concrete slabs through structural optimization has recently seen significant interest due to advancements in digital fabrication and the potential for more sustainable and architecturally expressive designs. However, many promising optimization-based approaches to shaping slabs do not consider secondary design aspects during computational exploration, including acoustics. This paper presents a computational investigation of trade-offs between structural and acoustic objectives using a multiobjective optimization framework while designing concrete slabs with curved ribs. A series of Pareto front approximations and constrained optimization runs at specific acoustic performance levels were used to explore optimal designs, while evaluating how a computational search for competing objectives distributes structural material. Shaped slabs were then compared to conventional floor assemblies.

Tese structures are prone to excessive wind-induced lateral vibrations in the crosswind direction owing to vortex shedding efects, causing occupant discomfort and, ultimately, dynamic serviceability failure. To reconcile the worldwide accelerated trend in constructing tall buildings with the sustainable building sector agenda, this paper proposes a novel bi-objective integrated design framework that leverages dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) to minimize the required material usage in the wind load-resisting structural systems (WLSSs) of occupant comfort-governed tall buildings. Te framework couples structural sizing optimization for minimum-weight WLSS design (objective 1), with optimal DVA tuning for foor acceleration minimization to satisfy codifed wind comfort design requirements by using the smallest DVA inertia (objective 2). Furthermore, a versatile numerical strategy is devised for the efcient solution of the proposed bi-objective optimization problem. For illustration, the framework is applied to a 15-storey steel building equipped with one of two diferent DVAs: a widely considered top-foor tuned mass damper (TMD) and an innovative ground-foor tuned inerter damper (TID). Te derived Pareto optimal integrated (WLSS-plus-DVA) designs demonstrate that signifcant reduction in both structural steel usage and embodied carbon emissions can be achieved using either one of the two DVAs with moderate inertia. It is concluded that the proposed optimization-driven design framework and numerical solution strategy ofer an alternative innovative approach to achieve material-efcient high-rise buildings under wind hazards.

Dual loss functions evaluated by a traditional data-driven discriminator and the Physics Estimator collaboratively foster the physics-enhanced GAN architecture. We further develop a structural mechanics model to train and optimize the inherent accuracy of the Physics Estimator. The comparative study suggests that the proposed physics-enhanced GAN can generate structural designs from architectural drawings and specified design conditions 44% better than a data-driven design method and 90 times faster than a competent engineer. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:20","2024-04-02 09:27:20","","1657-1676","","7","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 41</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eqe.3632","Architectural design; design method; Structural design; Interstory drifts; artificial neural network; Shear walls; wall; Neural-networks; seismic design; Surrogate modeling; surrogate method; data quality; earthquake-induced inter-story drift; Earthquake-induced inter-story drift; Elasticity; Generative adversarial networks; induced seismicity; intelligent generative structural design; Intelligent generative structural design; Network-based; neural network-based surrogate model; Neural network-based surrogate model; Physic-enhanced generative adversarial network; physics-enhanced generative adversarial network; Shear wall structural mechanic model; shear wall structural mechanics model; Structural mechanics models; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 7_Part of Building (Lateral system); 3_Stiffness (Story drift); 1_Topology (of shear walls, super-interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There have been limited attempts, and previous studies which targeted the optimisation of structural elements did not address the association of individual elements with the envelope shape of the overall building. This study presents a new Parametric BIM-based Optimality Criteria (PBIM-OC) method that enables multi-objective optimisation of envelope shape and element size for tall buildings. The study proposes a comprehensive parameterisation method to describe the complex geometrics of envelope shapes for high-rise buildings. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) were used to conduct multi-objective optimisation, providing optimal solutions for envelope shapes that maximise structural cost and operating energy efficiencies. The illustrative examples show a structurally inefficient building shape design can lead to a 60% of structural cost difference. This study contributes a new parametric optimisation method that explores optimal designs and investigates the influence of geometric changes in building envelopes on performance solutions. The results provide insights into the relationship between building envelopes and structural efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between structural material cost and energy performance of high-rise buildings.

Low-carbon designs have been explored by conducting both member-level and structure-level analyses for concrete structures. However, methods for combining two-tiered research need to be further developed to reduce the cost of design optimization. This study aims to propose a hybrid iterative approach for the low-carbon optimization of concrete framed structures. Accordingly, the integrated structural analysis was applied to design the initial scheme, subproject-based emission assessment was applied to identify the carbon-intensive structural components, and a genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the desired components subjected to relevant design constraints. A case study was made on a residential building to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. The optimization results indicated that a potential 18.3% and 4.2% reduction in the embodied emissions from the beams and the building main body were achieved, respectively. A further discussion also proposed that an optimized scheme for interior walls using lightweight panels resulted in a 12% reduction in carbon emissions compared to the initial scheme using masonry walls. The proposed method and results can facilitate understanding the low-carbon design optimization of reinforced concrete structures and, therefore, contribute to carbon reduction of the construction industry. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, the high computational cost of the structural analysis step hinders its application in practical cases. With regards to this problem, a novel hybrid optimization framework is developed in this study. Discrete variables, code-stipulated constraints and other construction requirements under multiple loading scenarios are considered. The hybrid optimization framework contains two steps: in the first step, a computationally efficient approximation of the optimization formulation is constructed using a combined response surface methodology (RSM). Combining all the design constraints, three sub-optimization problems are proposed based on the relaxation model of the original problem to update the response surface model in the near-optimum region. When the response surface model has sufficient accuracy in the near-optimum region, in the second step, a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is applied to search for the optimal solution utilizing the response surface model. By integrating the commercially available ETABS, a dedicated optimization software with an independent interface is developed and details for practical software development are included in this paper. Three examples of high-rise concrete building design are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework, and the results are compared to those of a general PSO algorithm. It is shown that, compared to the conventional design approach, a 14.3% reduction in material usage is achieved by the hybrid optimization framework. Additionally, the proposed framework significantly improves the computational efficiency compared to PSO. This methodology can therefore be used by engineers to optimize member sizes for high-rise buildings so that stable and sustainable designs can be achieved. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-04-02 09:27:20","2024-04-02 09:27:20","","","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 5</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105292","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Structural design; Tall buildings; Computational efficiency; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Structural optimization; Optimization framework; Surface properties; Software design; Particle size analysis; Response surface; Computer software; High rise; Discrete sizing optimization; High-rise concrete building; High-rise concrete buildings; Multiple loading; Multiple loading scenario; Multiple loading scenarios; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 6_Case study; 1_Size; 3_Weight/Mass; 7_Part of building (Shear walls)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, this paper presents a controlled framework for selecting the adequate structural floor system for reinforced concrete buildings and efficiently utilizing the corresponding construction materials. Optimization was performed using an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the total construction cost, considering the costs of concrete, steel reinforcement, formwork, and labor. In the problem formulation, the characteristic compressive strength of concrete was treated as a design variable because it affects the mechanical performance of concrete. The design variables included the column spacings, concrete dimensions, and steel reinforcement of different structural components. The constraints reflected the Egyptian code of practice provisions. Because the choice of the structural floor system affects the design details, three systems were considered: Solid slabs, flat slabs with drop panels, and flat slabs without drop panels. Two benchmark examples were presented, and the optimal design results of the structural floor systems were compared. The solid slab system had the lowest construction cost among the three structural floor systems. Comparative diagrams were developed to investigate the distribution of construction costs of each floor system. The results revealed that an adequate choice of design variables could save up to 17% of the building’s total construction cost. © 2022 by the authors.

Among these approaches, topology optimization is a significant design method.

Building upon our previously proposed multi-material bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (multi-material BESO) method, this paper presents the approaches for achieving diverse and competitive structural designs and then presents a practical application of the multi-material BESO method to the structural design of the core structure of a long-cantilevered building project called “Xiong'an Wings”. After an evolutionary design process based on the multi-material BESO method, an efficient frame with lower overall material costs, better static and dynamic performance compared to the initial design by experienced engineers is achieved. As the first practical application of the multi-material BESO method to a large-scale architectural design, the example of the “Xiong'an Wings” building demonstrates the tremendous prospects for the application of multi-material topology optimization technology to the generative design of innovative and efficient building structures. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:20","2024-04-02 09:27:20","","","","","325","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2023.117603","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations; Structural optimization; Topology; Topology optimization; Optimization method; Performance based; Topology optimisation; Iconic buildings; Long-cantilevered building; Multi materials; Multi-material topology optimization; Practical application; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stress; 2_Steel; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 6_Used cases; 1_Topology (interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is more cumbersome for reinforced concrete buildings with infill walls due to their nonlinear behavior. The objective of this study is to highlight the importance of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models to achieve the best performance in predicting the fundamental period of infilled RC frame buildings. To this end, three types of boosting algorithms have been chosen, namely: gradient boosting decision trees, lightGBM, and catboost. Compared to the default parameters for each model, the fine-tuning hyperparameter models with the Optuna framework yielded the best results, with a higher coefficient of determination and lower error values. Furthermore, the lightGBM model set by its optimized parameters outperformed the other two boosting methods. The feature selection technique emphasizes the five parameters’ contributions in estimating the building's fundamental period by demonstrating the effect of removing one or more parameters each time on determining this dynamic characteristic. Moreover, the multivariate adaptive regression splines is used to develop a mathematical expression for the fundamental period that outperformed building code formulas and some authors’ proposed equations. Finally, a set of smooth curves derived from the optimum lightGBM and MARS models were introduced, revealing that the models were not overfitting. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:19","2024-04-02 09:27:19","","918-927","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 1</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.05.052","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Structural design; Reinforced concrete; Fundamental period; Forecasting; Design parameters; Decision trees; Hyper-parameter; Default hyperparameter; Default hyperparameters; Feature Selection; Feature selection technique; Features selection; MARS; Selection techniques; Tuned hyperparameter; Tuned hyperparameters; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Others (period, interesting); 3_Others (prediction period)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The criteria for a more comprehensive sustainable approach are related to environmental, constructive, and durability aspects. The environmental factor is measured through CO2 emissions, considering its capture due to concrete carbonation. The use of multi-objective strategies is evident in solving the multi-criteria problem. Still, it is also proposed to formulate this problem with a single function containing all the criteria to solve it as a single-objective optimization problem. Strategies are also offered to perform multi-objective optimization based on Kriging metamodels. Several alternatives for multi-criteria decision-making are explored. The results show that multi-objective metamodel-based optimization is a good strategy for solving this problem. Alternatively, the results of the single-objective optimization of the multi-criteria problem are very satisfactory. The solutions obtained are analyzed according to the type of optimization and the decision-making criteria. Optimized solutions significantly improve the sustainability indexes compared to traditional design. Multi-criteria optimization contributes significantly to achieving these indexes. Therefore, the proposed methodology allows for the sustainable design of any reinforced concrete frame structure. It highlights the importance of integrating more encompassing formulations and advanced optimization techniques into traditional design procedures to adopt cleaner production practices in the construction sector. Finally, several promising lines of research are presented. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:19","2024-04-02 09:27:19","","","","","425","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139115","3_Carbon; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 2_Concrete; 7_Entire building; 1_Size; 4_MOO (3); 3_Others (service life); 3_Others (buildability)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagrid is the widespread type of tube system and consists of a diagonal grid of beams that wraps the building, forming a diamond pattern. It performs as lateral bracing and is additionally able to sustain vertical loading through axial forces. Despite its efficiency, a growing interest is recently observed in alternative geometries to replace the diagrid pattern and improve the architectural impact conferred by the building skin aesthetics on the urban environment. The paper pursues the use of a Voronoi mesh, in which the geometry of the cells is steered to known schemes for the structural design of a cantilever tube structure. The objective is to mimic a macroscopic structural behavior through a topology and size modification of the Voronoi mesh that increases the density for creating resisting paths with higher stiffness. The paper proposes a novel method Vorogrid for designing a new class of tall buildings equipped with an organic-looking and mechanically sound tube structure, which makes them a valuable alternative to competitors (diagrid, hexagrid, random Voronoi). Diagrids and hexagrids still remain more efficient in terms of forces and displacements but are characterized by a more usual appearance, instead Vorogrid offers more design control and better performances on average with respect to random Voronoi structures. This method is streamed into a pipeline that includes grid initialization strategies, geometric and structural optimization to mitigate the effects of the grid randomness, and structural sizing. © 2022 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:19","2024-04-02 09:27:19","","683-701","","6","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 2</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mice.12912","Architectural design; multistorey building; optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; design; Building design; Structural optimization; structural analysis; topology; Tube systems; Tubes (components); geometry; Axial forces; Diamond patterns; Its efficiencies; Lateral bracing; Mesh generation; stiffness; Tube-structure; Variable density; Vertical loadings; Voronoi; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 3_Stress; 2_Steel; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 1_Topology (interesting)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, generalized regression neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-GRNN) based surrogate model was constructed, and a multi-objective optimization framework based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and GA-GRNN surrogate model updating was proposed. The feasibility of multi-objective optimization framework based on surrogate model updating was verified by using the experimental wind pressure data of a supertall building model, and the influencing factors of optimization efficiency were analyzed. The results show that the proposed framework has satisfactory optimization accuracy and efficiency. The optimal sample data set proportional distribution (training set: verification set: test set, i.e., T: V: T) is 7:2:1. With the increase of the total number of sample points in the design space, the optimal proportion of the initial sample points decreases significantly. A thorough consideration of the acquisition time of a single sample value and the optimal proportion of initial sample points is helpful to improve the multi-objective optimization efficiency further. Therefore, for the optimization problems in engineering applications (especially supertall buildings), it is suggested that the reasonable proportion of initial sample points of the surrogate model should be determined according to the acquisition time of a single sample value and the total number of sample points in the design space. The framework is more suitable for complex problems with large total number of sample points in design space and long acquisition time of a single sample value. This study can provide a valuable reference for further research or efficient solution to multi-objective optimization problems in practical engineering applications (such as the optimization problem of supertall buildings). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:19","2024-04-02 09:27:19","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 4</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106702","Architectural design; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Structural optimization; Neural networks; Surrogate model; Multiobjective optimization; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Efficiency; Surrogate modeling; Optimization framework; Multi-objectives optimization; Generalized regression; Generalized regression neural network; Multi-objective optimization framework; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II); Refinement update; Regression neural networks; Statistical tests; 1_Shape; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 2_Others (Not Specified); 3_Others (not readable); 4_MOO (number unknown); 7_Others (not readable)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corner aerodynamic modifications such as chamfered, recessed, rounded, and fins are investigated. The corner modification was limited to a cutting radius of 6 m (12% of the building width) with a 0.5 m increment. The main considerations for this optimization procedure are top deflection, inter-story drifts, and the optimal number of additional floors. All corner modifications improve the building's performance, except fins corners resulting in adverse effects. In addition, 47 simulation examples from the case study are evaluated, presented, and discussed. With one additional floor, the optimum shape was able to reduce overall wind loads by 31.67%, resulting in a reduction in the structural response of 24.89% and 24.18% in maximum top deflection and inter-story drift, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:18","2024-04-02 09:27:18","","","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107017","Architectural design; Floors; Optimisations; Structural design; Tall buildings; Wind load; Wind stress; Optimization; Aerodynamic loads; Interstory drifts; Aerodynamics; Computational approach; Computational fluid dynamics; CFD; Fins (heat exchange); Aerodynamic drag; Aerodynamic modifications; Aerodynamics optimizations; Corner modifications; Drag; Effective tool; Lateral load resisting systems; Octagonal shapes; 1_Shape; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 2_Others (Not Specified); 3_Stiffness (top deflection)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To optimize this type of structure while considering both optimization efficiency and structural reliability, an optimization method based on an improved DIviding RECTangle algorithm and combined response surface models is proposed herein. Firstly, the standardized section number of components with the same initial section dimension and material strength grade is treated as a variable. Each variable represents a dimension of the initial hyperrectangle, and the subdivision sequence is determined based on the design priority index. Subsequently, after each subdivision, potential optimal hyperrectangles are identified by evaluating the objective function value with constraint penalties at hyperrectangle center points and the distance from the points to the vertices. By continuously subdividing the potential optimal hyperrectangles, initial sampling points are obtained. Furthermore, combined response surface models for the objective and constraint functions are constructed. Finally, by continuously solving the sub-optimization problem to update the response surface models until the algorithm converges, the optimization of structural cost can be achieved. The case studies demonstrate that this method is capable of satisfying the structural constraints while efficiently optimizing the section dimension of high-rise building components. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:18","2024-04-02 09:27:18","","","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.105437","Architectural design; Concretes; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tall buildings; Geometry; Structural optimization; Optimization method; Steel-concrete composite; Surface properties; Combined response surface model; Composite buildings; Design priority index; Dividing rectangle algorithm; DIviding RECTangle algorithm; Dividing rectangles; High rise; High-rise steel–concrete composite building; High-rise steel–concrete composite buildings; Rectangles algorithms; Response surface modelling; Section dimension; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 3_Cost; 1_Size; 2_Composite (Concrete, Steel)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such early decisions, which must be given in a short timeframe, have the largest impact on a project's quality, cost and embodied carbon. This study showed how much the conceptual design decisions affect the cost and carbon footprint of a building's structure using our Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II tool. First, we tested the tool's reliability by comparing its solutions with three case studies from literature. Then, we showed that by quickly examining various conceptual design solutions on a Pareto graph (which spotlights cost and CO2-optimized options), more sustainable design alternatives can be identified. Then, using the tool, we analyzed 36 building configurations, providing a spectrum of embodied carbon emissions (including the life cycle assessment steps A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, C2, C3, C4) ranging between 60 and 360 kgCO2e/m2. By comparing 25 material types from 15 databases (EPDs and ICE), we concluded that the geometry decisions (span length, height and shape) have the largest influence, material type (steel, timber, reinforced concrete), recycling and reuse of steel are crucial, and the embodied carbon calculations are highly sensitive to the supplier data and location.

Considering that construction constitutes one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of a building, there is an urgent desire to incorporate timber into this domain. Nevertheless, the use of timber faces inherent challenges stemming from its anisotropic nature, a result of the natural growth of timber fibers, which makes it challenging for it to function as a primary load-bearing material in coping with the various complex stresses inherent in architectural applications. Numerous designers have attempted to address this limitation through over-sized members and reinforcement at joints; however, none have satisfactorily resolved this issue in an economical manner. In this article, we introduce the Strut-and-Tie models (STM) from Graphic Statics (GS) and a topological optimization algorithm. This algorithm has the capability to generate a ‘load-minimizing path’ STM based on external load support conditions and the maximum structural path span. Regardless of the complexity of the initial external loads, each load transfer path in the optimized STM bears loads in only one direction, representing an optimal solution with minimal internal loads that align seamlessly with the characteristics of timber. Consequently, we endeavor to adopt this optimization algorithm to propose a structural design methodology, with the aspiration of designing structural systems that harness the unique attributes of timber perfectly and applying them to various architectural scenarios. Ultimately, we conclude that structural systems designed based on optimized STM are adaptable to diverse architectural contexts, and when applied to small-scale buildings, this method can save approximately 20% of material consumption compared to conventional timber frame structures, while in the case of mid-rise to high-rise buildings, it can lead to a material savings of approximately 5%. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-04-02 09:27:18","2024-04-02 09:27:18","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 20 February 2024; Cited By: 0</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13122946","Architectural design; Carbon; Structural design; Tall buildings; Optimization algorithms; Life cycle; Construction industry; Structural optimization; Structural systems; timber; Timber; Low carbon; Structure optimization; External loads; Graphic methods; graphic statics; Graphic statics; Model optimization; Structure design; structure optimization; Strut-and-tie model; strut-and-tie models; Timber structures; 4_SOO; 5_Multistory; 6_Methodology; 6_Case study; 7_Entire building; 2_Timber; 3_Stress (Force); 1_Topology (unprefered example); 5_Others (Stairs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
